# ****************************************************************************
# NOTES:
#
# This is an example of a production deployment that uses GitHub Pages along
# with a second "production" GitHub organisation. If you prefer to implement
# your own workflow, or do not need production deployments, then you should
# delete this file.
#
# In order for this to work, you must replace PRODUCTION_ORGANISATION below
# with the name of your production GitHub organisation, under REPOSITORY_NAME.
# You must also replace PRODUCTION_REPOSITORY below with the name of your
# production data repository.
#
# For example, if your production organisation is "my-stats-org", and your
# production data repository is "sdg-data", then use:
#
# REPOSITORY_NAME: my-stats-org/sdg-data
