Increasing resilience of cities is critical to reduce disaster risk and achieve sustainable development. Cities are also very vulnerable to natural disasters, especially climate-related shocks. Over half of all coastal areas are urbanized and 21 of the world's 33 megacities lie in coastal flood zones. Coastal cities are particularly affected by sea level rise, coastal flooding and erosion, and extreme events (e.g. tsunamis and storm surges) due to the undermining natural protective barriers, low levels of development combined with rapid population growth in low lying coastal areas and inadequate capacity to adapt. In addition to the impact on communities and non-human species, the unplanned urbanization also undermines the ecosystem services that support much hard urban infrastructure. This type of development also exacerbates urban vulnerability to climate change impacts, including hydro-meteorological and geological hazards. \nLocated mostly in cities where disadvantaged groups are situated and when affordable access is addressed, resilient infrastructures such as health, education, road and other critical infrastructures will have direct impact on reducing inequality and making growth more inclusive and sustainable. \nThe opportunity is that 60% of the area expected to be urban by 2030 remains to be built, indicating that the shape of future cities can be proactively guided into more risk-sensitive development. An increasing number of cities that adopt and implement local DRR strategies will contribute to sustainable development from economic, environmental and social perspectives. \nThe indicator will build bridge between the SDGs and the Sendai Framework for DRR because the adoption of local DRR strategies is one of Sendai Framework global targets and will be also monitored under the Sendai Framework Monitoring System. \n(mainly based on TST Issue Brief 20, 11, 23, 14 and 12)","sdg_goal":11,"source_active_1":true,"source_agency_staff_email_1":"Elan_P_Strait@nsc.eop.gov","source_agency_staff_name_1":"Elan Strait","source_agency_survey_dataset_1":"National Security Council/Executive Office of the President","source_notes_1":null,"source_organisation_1":"National Security Council/Executive Office of the President","source_title_1":null,"source_url_1":"https://www.dhs.gov/presidential-policy-directive-8-national-preparedness","source_url_text_1":"https://www.dhs.gov/presidential-policy-directive-8-national-preparedness","target":"By 2020, substantially increase the number of cities and human settlements adopting and implementing integrated policies and plans towards inclusion, resource efficiency, mitigation and adaptation to climate change, resilience to disasters, and develop and implement, in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, holistic disaster risk management at all levels.","target_id":"11.b","title":"Number of countries that adopt and implement national disaster risk reduction strategies in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030","un_custodial_agency":"UNISDR (Partnering Agencies: UN Habitat, UNEP)","un_designated_tier":"1","us_method_of_computation":"US Presidential Policy Directive 8: National Preparedness, including the National Preparedness Goal and the National Preparedness System","variable_description":null,"variable_notes":null,"national_metadata_updated_date":"2023-07-17","national_data_updated_date":"2024-06-06","SDG_GOAL__GLOBAL":"<p>Goal 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts</p>","SDG_TARGET__GLOBAL":"<p>Target 13.1: Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries</p>","SDG_INDICATOR__GLOBAL":"<p>Indicator 13.1.2: Number of countries that adopt and implement national disaster risk reduction strategies in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015&#x2013;2030</p>","META_LAST_UPDATE__GLOBAL":"<p>2017-07-07</p>","SDG_RELATED_INDICATORS__GLOBAL":"<p>1.5; 11.5; 11.b; 13.1; 2.4; 3.6; 3.9; 3.d; 4.a; 6.6; 9.1; 9.a; 11.1; 11.3; 11.c; 13.2; 13.3; 13.a; 13.b; 14.2; 15.1; 15.2; 15.3; 15.9.</p>","SDG_CUSTODIAN_AGENCIES__GLOBAL":"<p>United Nations Office for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR)</p>","CONTACT_ORGANISATION__GLOBAL":"<p>United Nations Office for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR)</p>","STAT_CONC_DEF__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>\n<p>NA</p>\n<p>[a] An open-ended intergovernmental expert working group on indicators and terminology relating to disaster risk reduction established by the General Assembly (resolution 69/284) is developing a set of indicators to measure global progress in the implementation of the Sendai Framework.
