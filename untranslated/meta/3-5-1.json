Comprehensive treatment system offering a wide range of integrated pharmacological (such as detoxification and opioid agonist and antagonist maintenance) and psychosocial (such as counselling, cognitive behavioural therapy and social support) interventions based on scientific evidence and focused on the process of rehabilitation, recovery and social reintegration (Plan of Action, Para 4:h) Services for the treatment of drug disorders' are part of clinical responses to substancerelated disorders. Such services are aimed at stopping or reducing the effects of acute intoxication, managing withdrawal symptoms during detoxification, preventing relapse and dealing with long-term psychological and behavioural symptoms.. (E/NR/2014/2)1 Substance use disorders, occur when the recurrent use of alcohol and/or drugs causes clinically and functionally significant impairment, such as health problems, disability, and failure to meet major responsibilities at work, school, or home. According to the DSM-5, a diagnosis of substance use disorder is based on evidence of impaired control, social impairment, risky use, and pharmacological criteria. (DSM V) Pharmacological Interventions include cluster of interventions such as detoxification, , opioid antagonist therapy, and opioid maintenance therapy (E/NR/2014/2) \tDetoxification refers to a process carried out in a safe and effective manner aimed at eliminating or minimizing withdrawal symptoms that occur after drugs are no longer taken (WHO). \tOpioid maintenance therapy refers to the regular administration of a long-acting opioid agonist to stabilize the patient without applying tapering dosage schedules. (WHO, UNODC, UNAIDS Technical Guide for Countries to Set Targets for Universal Access to HIV Prevention, Treatment and Care for Injecting Drug Users (WHO, Geneva, 2009) \tOpioid antagonist maintenance treatment refers to the regular administration of a long-acting opioid antagonist to block opioid receptors and avoid any opioid effect (adapted from WHO, 2009). Psychosocial cluster of interventions such as treatment planning, counselling, peer support groups, screening/brief intervention, contingency management, cognitive behavioural therapy, treatment of comorbidity, motivational interviewing. \tTreatment planning refers to the development of a written description of the treatment to be provided and its anticipated course. Such planning is done with the patient by establishing goals based on the patient's identified needs and setting interventions to meet those goals (UNODC, Principles of Drug Dependence Treatment: Discussion Paper, March 2008). \tCounselling refers to an intensive interpersonal process aimed at assisting individuals to achieve their goals or function more effectively (WHO). \tPeer support groups (self-help groups such as Narcotics Anonymous) refers to small groups of peers wishing to assist each other in their struggle with a particular problem (in the case of Narcotics Anonymous, with drug dependence) (WHO). \tScreening is aimed at detecting health problems or risk factors at an early stage before they have caused serious disease or other problems (WHO). A 'brief intervention' is a structured therapy of short duration aimed at assisting an individual to cease or reduce the use of a psychoactive substance or to deal with other life issues (WHO). \tContingency management' refers to psychosocial interventions that provide a system of incentives and disincentives designed to make drug use less attractive and abstinence more attractive (NIDA). \tCognitive behavioural therapy refers to psychosocial interventions aimed at helping patients recognize, avoid and cope with the situations in which they are most likely to use drugs (adapted from NIDA). \tMotivational interviewing refers to a counselling and assessment technique that follows a non-confrontational approach to questioning people about difficult issues like alcohol and drug use, assisting them to make positive decisions aimed at reducing or stopping such use (ODCCP). Social rehabilitation and aftercare include a cluster of interventions such as vocational training, social assistance, educational activities, rehabilitation and aftercare. \tVocational training and income-generation support' refers to activities aimed at providing participants with the skills and opportunities to engage in meaningful employment and sustainably support themselves and their families. \tSocial assistance refers to the many ways in which professionals and nonprofessionals can support the social and psychological well-being of drug users with a view to improving both the quality and duration of their lives (WHO, Guidelines for the Psychosocially Assisted Pharmacological Treatment of Opioid Dependence, 2009). \tEducational activities on the risks posed by drug use refer to sessions aimed at informing and counselling people about the consequences of drug use, in other words, the ways in which such use affects physical and mental health, behavioural control and interpersonal relationships. In particular, these educational sessions should focus on providing information about overdosing, contracting infectious diseases, developing cardiovascular, metabolic and psychiatric disorders etc. and the benefit of abstaining from drug use. Treatment methods and goals are also explained in detail. \tRehabilitation and aftercare refers to the process aimed at achieving an optimal state of health, psychological functioning and social well-being for individuals with a drugrelated problem (WHO). Coverage Coverage describes the extent to which an intervention is delivered to the target population, that is, the proportion of the target population in need of an intervention that actually gets it. Coverage has to be determined relative to the national estimates of people in need, e.g., people with substance use disorders, or people vulnerable to substance use.

The concept of &#x201C;substance use disorders&#x201D; includes both &#x201C;drugs use disorders&#x201D; and &#x201C;alcohol use disorders&#x201D; according to the <a href=\"https://icd.who.int/browse10/2016/en\" target=\"_blank\">International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10 and ICD-11)</a><sup><a href=\"#footnote-3\" id=\"footnote-ref-3\">[2]</a></sup>. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The term &#x201C;drugs&#x201D; refers to controlled psychoactive substances as scheduled by the three <a href=\"https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/commissions/CND/conventions.html\" target=\"_blank\">Drug Control Conventions (1961, 1971 and 1988)</a>, substances controlled under national legislations, new psychoactive substances (NPS) and some other that are not controlled under the Conventions, but may pose a public health threat. &#x201C;Alcohol&#x201D; refers to ethanol - a psychoactive substance with dependence producing properties that is consumed in ethanol-based alcoholic beverages or their surrogates. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>People with substance use disorders are those with harmful patterns of substance use or substance dependence. Harmful pattern of substance use is defined in the ICD-11 as a pattern of use of substances that has caused damage to a person&#x2019;s physical or mental health or has resulted in behaviour leading to harm to the health of others. According to ICD-11, dependence arises from repeated or continuous use of psychoactive substances. The characteristic feature is a strong internal drive to use psychoactive substance, which is manifested by impaired ability to control use, increasing priority given to use over other activities and persistence of use despite harm or negative consequences. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Within this context treatment interventions for substance use disorders include any structured intervention that is aimed specifically to a) reduce substance use and cravings for substance use; b) improve health, well-being and social functioning of the affected individual, and c) prevent future harms by decreasing the risk of complications and relapse. These may include pharmacological treatment, psychosocial interventions and rehabilitation and aftercare. All evidence-based used for treatment of substance use disorders are well defined in WHO and UNODC related documents. Though hazardous substance use is not included in the concept of &#x201C;substance use disorder&#x201D;, such patterns of substance use are important targets for prevention interventions in health systems, and such interventions are included in the overall scope of comprehensive health system responses to &#x201C;substance abuse&#x201D; as defined in SDG 3.5.1 indicator. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><u>Pharmacological treatment</u> refers to evidence-based interventions that include administration of pharmacological agents or medicines in the context of different treatment modalities and interventions, including withdrawal management; treatment of alcohol use disorders with baclofen, naltrexone, acamprosate and disulfiram; management of opioid dependence with opioid agonists (methadone, buprenorphine) and antagonists (naltrexone); and prevention and management of opioid overdose with naloxone (WHO/UNODC International Standards for the treatment of drug use disorders<sup><a href=\"#footnote-4\" id=\"footnote-ref-4\">[3]</a></sup>, 2020 and WHO Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) guideline for mental, neurological and substance use disorders, 2023<sup><a href=\"#footnote-5\" id=\"footnote-ref-5\">[4]</a></sup> ).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><u>Psychosocial interventions</u> refer to programs that address motivational, behavioral, psychological, social, and environmental factors related to substance use and have been shown to improve quality of life and well-being, reduce psychoactive substance use, promote abstinence and prevent relapse. For different substance use disorders, the evidence from clinical trials supports the effectiveness of treatment planning, screening and brief intervention (SBI), counselling, peer support groups, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), motivational interviewing (MI), community reinforcement approach (CRA), motivational enhancement therapy (MET), family therapy (FT) modalities, contingency management (CM), counselling, insight-oriented treatments, housing and employment support among others.

Untreated substance use disorders trigger substantial costs to society including lost productivity, increased health care expenditure, and costs related to criminal justice, social welfare, and other social consequences. Strengthening treatment services entails providing access to a comprehensive set of evidence-based interventions (-laid down in the international standards and guidelines) that should be available to all population groups in need. The indicator will inform the extent to which a range of evidence-based interventions for treatment of substance use disorder are available and are accessed by the population in need at country, regional and global level. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Even though effective treatment exists, only a small amount of people with substance use disorders receive it. For instance, it is estimated that globally one out of 7 people with drug use disorders have access to or provided drug treatment services (World Drug Report 2019). <a href=\"https://www.who.int/gho/substance_abuse/en/\" target=\"_blank\">WHO ATLAS-Substance Use</a> data showed that in 2014 only 11.9 % (out of 103 responding) countries reported high coverage (40% or more) for alcohol dependence.

There are issues of under-reporting for certain psychoactive substances, in countries where stigma is associated to substance use and when a considerable proportion of the drug or alcohol using population is institutionalized, homeless or unreachable by population-based surveys. Additionally, being a relatively rare event, household surveys on substance use disorders require a large sample and can be costly. In order to address these issues, additional approaches (e.g. scale up methods) are increasingly used in household surveys to address undercount issues. These can be used in conjunction with special studies and/or additional information, in order to obtain reasonable estimates via indirect methods, such as benchmark/multiplier or capture-recapture methods.</p>\n<p>Given these challenges, often national officially produced estimates on the number of people with drug use disorders are not available. In this context, additional sources are considered, such as the estimates produced by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), and published through the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study.

In addition, once a year data available through the ARQ and other sources are shared with ARQ Focal Points for their review in a pre-publication process related to UNODC&#x2019;s flagship publication, the World Drug Report. Finally, data compiled for the SDG indicator 3.5.1 are shared with SDG Focal Points for their feedback and review, during the SDG pre-publication process before submission to UNSD every March. All feedback received by Member States related to these data are incorporated. </p>\n<p><strong>Alcohol and other psychoactive substances</strong></p>\n<p>WHO Global Survey on Progress with SDG Health Target 3.5 collects data from WHO focal points in Ministries of Health, nominated by their governments to participate in the survey. The WHO&apos;s LimeSurvey platform is used to collect information. Respondents are encouraged to contact and consult additional experts from the following areas: (1) persons in charge of or involved in alcohol/drug control in the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Justice or other ministry, or the most senior government official in charge of alcohol control or alcohol-related conditions, or drug demand reduction programmes; (2) the head of a prominent non-governmental organization dedicated to alcohol/drug control; (3) a health professional (e.g., medical doctor, nurse, pharmacist, social worker, psychologist) who specialized in alcohol-related conditions and conditions due to other SU; (4) a faculty member of a public health or other relevant university department; (5) a police or other law enforcement officer; (6) a person at the Ministry of Finance, tax agency or statistical office; (7) a researcher, civil servant, or faculty member with expertise in treatment systems for SUD and treatment/service coverage. Adjusted for comparability, country summaries with data points are validated through the established network of WHO focal points to ensure data accuracy prior to their publication. Data validation processes include checking of internal consistency, identification of outliers and checking consistency with previously reported data, and discrepancies in data are communicated to the focal points for clarification. </p>","ADJUSTMENT__GLOBAL":"<p>Adjustments may take place to fit the age group requirements of the indicator (people 15 years of age and older), depending on the national data available. </p>","IMPUTATION__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>At country level </strong></p>\n<p>For drug use disorders, data will be reported for countries where information is available for both numerator and denominator, either via data reported by the government or produced by other sources mentioned in this document.

It is planned to update these guidelines in the near future. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As part of the Annual Report Questionnaire (ARQ) review process, UNODC is planning to enhance its capacity building tools by complementing regional and national capacity building activities with: </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>E-learning training modules with incorporated training curricula </li>\n  <li>Creating methodological guidelines and tools on drug-related issues, including drug use disorders and treatment </li>\n  <li>promoting national coordination mechanisms on drugs data, including national drug observatories </li>\n</ul>\n<p>WHO has published series of documents on alcohol monitoring in populations (e.g. International Guide for Monitoring Alcohol Consumption and Related Harm), and established a <a href=\"https://www.who.int/substance_abuse/activities/gisah/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Global Information System on Alcohol and Health (GISAH)</a> that provides easy and rapid access to a wide range of alcohol-related health indicators. It is an essential tool for assessing and monitoring the health situation and trends related to alcohol consumption, alcohol-related harm, and policy responses in countries. Data on prevalence of alcohol use disorders at national, regional and global levels have been regularly reported by WHO and included among the key indicators in periodic WHO publications such as global status reports on alcohol and health. GISAH is a further development of the Global Alcohol Database which has been built since 1997 by the WHO Department of Mental Health and Substance Use. The main purpose of GISAH is to serve WHO Member States and governmental and nongovernmental organizations by making alcohol-related health data available. These data can help to analyse the state of the health situation related to alcohol in a country, a WHO region or sub-region, or the world. <a href=\"https://www.who.int/substance_abuse/activities/gisah_indicatorbook.pdf?ua=1\" target=\"_blank\">The Indicator Code Book</a> has been prepared to assist countries in collecting the data. </p>","QUALITY_MGMNT__GLOBAL":"<p>The prepublication processes conducted for most UNODC and WHO data collections as described in the Validation section above allow to properly manage the quality of the data submitted. In particular, as data for the SDG indicator 3.5.1 are shared with different Focal Points (from the drugs and the SDG sides), often representing different institutions within the national system, this allows for consolidating a national figure on the indicator and other key drug-demand indicators, such as people in treatment and people with alcohol/drug use disorders. </p>","QUALITY_ASSURE__GLOBAL":"<p>At UNODC, quality assurance measures are in place to collect, process and disseminate statistical data. They build on the &#x2018;Principles governing international statistical activities&#x2019; and regulate the collection, processing, publication and dissemination of data. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>All data for SDG indicators as compiled by the Office are sent to countries (through the relevant national focal points) for their review before statistical data are officially released by UNODC. When countries provide feedback/comments on the data, a technical discussion is conducted to identify a common position. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>At WHO quality assurance measures are in place for producing the health statistics that include the main indicators on alcohol consumption and its health consequences. WHO Technical Advisory Group on Alcohol and Drug Epidemiology provides technical advice and input to WHO activities on monitoring alcohol consumption and treatment capacity for substance use disorders in its Member States. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Data compilation is to be performed centrally by WHO and UNODC based on data collected from countries that later will be validated through official focal points. </p>","QUALITY_ASSMNT__GLOBAL":"<p>As for certain regions there could be different data published at the international level on the indicators used for the calculation of the indicator, i.e., people in treatment for alcohol/drug use disorders and people with alcohol/drug use disorders, there is an exercise of data exchange taking place with key actors, including WHO regional offices and other regional organizations such as the European Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA). This exercise, together with the validation and prepublication processes described before, allows to produce the most accurate data as possible. It is important to note that in cases the production of these indicators at the national level, especially for the estimation of people with alcohol/drug use disorders, can differ in definition from country to country depending on the methodology used. While UNODC and WHO strives to publish data that is as comparable as possible, cases that differ from the standard definitions are clearly identified in the corresponding footnotes. Ideally, this would require additional activities that would allow in-depth data collection in selected countries: a future direction for strengthening the indicator.</p>","COVERAGE__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>\n<p>Data on treatment of people with alcohol/drug use disorders is widely available countries as it relies on administrative data. While data on the estimated number of people with drug use disorders can be scarce in certain regions as it relies in data from surveys or indirect methods, external sources such as the ones mentioned in this document can provide a coverage for almost all countries in the world. As a consequence, data on this indicator is available for over 100 countries globally. The indicator can also be disaggregated by gender and substance based on the data available. </p>\n<p>Data on prevalence of alcohol use disorders are currently available for 188 Member States (for 2012, 2016, 2019) and validated through the process of country consultation. Data are regularly updated and presented through WHO Global Health Observatory. For utilization of treatment by people with alcohol use disorders, data are currently available for at least 30 countries and further data collection is ongoing </p>\n<p>For contextual information on treatment services, WHO has collected data from 145 countries for 2019 and extended to all countries using multiple imputation (described above). New round of data collection is taking place in 2023-2024.. </p>\n<p><strong>Time series: </strong></p>\n<p>During 2015-2021, data are available for over XX countries for at least two years for both numerator and denominator necessary for the calculation of the SDG indicator on drug use disorders. For the alcohol, data on denominator are available for a long period since establishment of GISAH in 1997 and the indicator has been tentatively calculated for at least 30 countries in 2019, with contextual comparable information available for 188 countries. </p>\n<p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>\n<p>Given the policy importance, the indicator will be disaggregated to provide data for drugs and alcohol.
