Note that parity measures suggested above are highly sensitive to small differences and do not account for differences strictly due to standard errors of the samples. The problem with the suggested metric is compounded when comparing relatively small percentages. So, if 10 percent of males and 12 percent of females were enrolled at a particular level, and there was a standard error of .75 on each metric, there would be no significant difference yet the parity ratio as specified above would be .83 which might suggest a substantial difference. The two point difference flipping the perspective to 88 and 90 percent enrolled would yield a metric of 98, which would be more in line with the non-significant difference. As a result of these concerns with the specified metrics and the nonlinear aspect of the metric, we strongly recommend a different approach be used to compare across countries when the differences from country to country in the raw metrics may be assumed to be very large.","date_metadata_updated":"11/2016","date_of_national_source_publication":"Varies","disaggregation_categories":"National and gender for most indicators.","disaggregation_geography":"National","goal_meta_link":"http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-4.pdf","has_metadata":true,"indicator":"4.5.1","indicator_definition":"Parity indices require no additional data than the specific disaggregations of interest.
