  The reported estimates were derived by combining two years of NHANES data
  (e.g., 1999–2000). Data is also accessible for the COVID period (e.g.,
  2017–2020 = 3.9), wherein the computation was derived from a dataset spanning
  3.2 years, deviating from the conventional two-year data cycle. The estimated
  percent meets the NCHS standards for reliability and precision. 
DATA_COMP: >-
  The number of children from birth through <5 years with height-for-age more
  than 2 standard deviations below the median length/height-for-age was divided
  by the total number of children from birth through 5 years and the result was
  multiplied by 100.  The numbers and resulting estimate are weighted to be
  nationally representative.  The 2013-2014 NHANES data were merged with the
  expanded WHO growth chart files of length/height-for-age for boys and girls by
  age in days. Age in months at examination on the NHANES 2013-2014 file was
  converted to age in days by multiplying it by 30.4375 and taking the largest
  integer of the result.
