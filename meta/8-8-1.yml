  fatal: Hours-based fatal injury rates from CFOI are available from 2006 to
  2016. Earlier fatal injury rates were employment-based and are not directly
  comparable to the hours-based rates. More information on the differences
  between hours-based and employment-based fatal injury rates can be found here:
  https://www.bls.gov/iif/additional-resources/cfoi-hours-based-rates.htm;
  non-fatal: non-fatal rate data are not available prior to 2009. Beginning with
  the 2021-2022 time period, nonfatal rates represent a change in methodology.
  Data are now representative of a biennial, two-year period, and published
  every other year. The incidence rates for the biennial data represent the
  number of injuries and illnesses per 10,000 full time workers and are
  annualized to represent the incidence of injury or illness for one year. More
  information on the calculation of this incidence rate:
