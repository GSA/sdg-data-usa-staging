  Steps for computing the indicator: 1. Retrieved monitor-level PM2.5 annual
  mean values from EPA's Air Quality System. (These annual means are the average
  of the four calendar quarter averages. At least 11 24-hour observations in
  each calendar quarter are required for the annual mean to be valid.  Otherwise
  it is invalid and not used.) 2. The highest annual mean among all monitors in
  each city, as defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget's 2013
  definition of Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSA) was computed to represent
  each CBSA. 3. For each CBSA, multiplied the CBSA's maximum annual mean by the
  CBSA's 2010 population. 4. Summed this population-weighted annual mean across
  all CBSAs with data. 5. Divided this sum by the sum of all CBSAs with data. 6.
  Resulting value is an average population-weighted concentration.

  Note that a constant population (2010) was used.  Note that the number of
  cities that have data varies from year to year.

  2000 to most recent complete year of data.  Ambient monitoring data for PM2.5
  for a given calendar year is typically not available until May/June of the
  following year.
