STAT_CONC_DEF: >-
  The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in partnership with
  the States, biennially collects information regarding the generation,
  management, and final disposition of hazardous wastes regulated under the
  Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), as amended. 


  The term "RCRA hazardous waste" refers to solid waste assigned a Federal
  Hazardous Waste Code and regulated by RCRA. Some States elect to regulate
  wastes not specifically regulated by EPA; these wastes are assigned State
  Hazardous Waste Codes. In regard to the Biennial Report, EPA has asked the
  States to exclude data for waste with only State Hazardous Waste Codes (i.e.,
  the waste description does not include any Federal Hazardous Waste Codes).

  The total hazardous waste generated in the reporting year was divided by the
  population of the U.S. for that reporting year. Like wise each treatment
  method was divided by the total quantity of waste treated to get the percent
  for each treatment method.
