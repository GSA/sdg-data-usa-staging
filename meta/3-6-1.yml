  (V02–V04[.1,.9],V09.2,V12–V14[.3–.9],V19[.4–.6],V20–V28[.3–.9],V29–V79[.4–.9],V80[.3–.5],V81.1,V82.1,V83–V86[.0–.3],V87[.0–.8],V89.2)
DATA_COMP: >-
  Number of deaths attributable to traffic injuries divided by the population
  and expressed per 100,000 population.  Rates are age-adjusted to the 2000 US
  standard population using the direct method of applying age-specific death
  rates to the U.S. standard population distribution. See
