  The first round of data collection in the United States (officially known as
  the U.S. PIAAC Main Study) was conducted from August 2011 through April 2012
  with a nationally representative household sample of 5,000 adults between the
  ages of 16 and 65.

  Weighted percentage of 16- to 65-year-olds performing at PIAAC literacy or
  numeracy level 3 or higher
actual_indicator_available_description: >-
  PIAAC measures literacy and numeracy in both paper and computer modes. Items
  that measure problem solving in technology-rich environments are only
  computer-administered. Reading components tasks are only administered in the
  paper-and-pencil mode. All participating countries are required to assess the
  literacy and numeracy domains, but the problem solving and reading components
  domains are both optional. The United States assessed all four domains. PIAAC
  tasks developed for all four domains are authentic, culturally appropriate,
  and drawn from real-life situations that are expected to be of importance or
  relevance in different contexts. Tasks' contents and questions are intended to
  reflect the purposes of adults' daily lives across cultures, even if they are
  not necessarily familiar to all adults in all countries.
