  The U.S. Census Bureau is federally mandated to follow the structure of the
  Standard Occupation Classification (SOC) Manual. The SOC is revised
  periodically to account for changes in the economy. The estimates presented in
  this indicator span across multiple revisions of the SOC: 2000, 2010, and
  2018. In order to make estimates comparable across times, estimates prior to
  2018 were converted to the 2018 Census Occupation Code List. As a result, the
  estimates for years prior to 2018 will vary from those published on
  data.census.gov.


  Occupation codes are 4-digit codes and are based on Standard Occupational
  Classification 2018.
DATA_COMP: >-
  Data are based on a sample and are subject to sampling variability. The degree
  of uncertainty for an estimate arising from sampling variability is
  represented through the use of a margin of error. The margin of error for the
  data provided is +/-.2 (this is the 90 percent margin of error). The margin of
  error can be interpreted roughly as providing a 90 percent probability that
  the interval defined by the estimate minus the margin of error and the
  estimate plus the margin of error (the lower and upper confidence bounds)
  contains the true value.  In addition to sampling variability, the ACS
  estimates are subject to nonsampling error. The effect of nonsampling error is
  not represented in these data.
