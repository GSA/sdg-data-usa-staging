  Number of people receiving the intervention / Number of people who need the
  intervention


  Method of measurement


  Universal health coverage means that people receive the services they need,
  without incurring financial hardship. Countries progressively realize UHC
  according to their level of development, epidemiological situation, health
  system and people's expectations. The indicators ideally cover promotion,
  prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and palliation. There are a number of
  indicators that all countries implement such as immunization coverage or
  skilled attendance at birth that can be used for a summary measure of progress
  that can be used at lgobal and regional and country levels. Countries however
  will also create their own set of indicators to track progress towards UHC.
  The selection of indicators is based on the initial framework, and was applied
  in the global report published in 2015 by WHO and the World Bank. This
  provides a basis for further improvements working alongside countries.


  Method of estimation


  The indicators can be expressed as a summary measure. These can be weighted
  according to indicator, or intervention area. Work on incorporating an equity
  component in the summary measure is ongoing but is possible in a relatively
  simple manner.
