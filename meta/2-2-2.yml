  2.2.2 The reported estimates were derived by combining two years of NHANES
  data (e.g., 1999–2000). Data is also accessible for the COVID period (e.g.,
  2017–2020 = 0.0), wherein the computation was derived from a dataset spanning
  3.2 years, deviating from the conventional two-year data cycle. The estimates
  for percent wasting and overweight met the NCHS standards for reliability and
  precision, and the confidence interval width for both estimates was less than
  5 percent.
DATA_COMP: >-
  The NHANES data were merged with the expanded WHO growth chart files of
  weight-for-length/height for boys and girls by age. For the wasting estimate,
  the number of children 5 and younger with weight-for-length/height 2 or more
  standard deviations below the median weight-for-length/height was divided by
  the total number of children from birth through 5 years and the result was
  multiplied by 100. For the overweight estimate, the number of children with
  weight-for-length/height 2 or more standard deviations above the median
  weight-for-length/height was divided by the total number of children from
  birth through 5 years and the result was multiplied by 100. The numbers and
  resulting estimates are weighted to be nationally representative.
