SDG_INDICATOR: >-
  Proportion of women and girls aged 15 years and older subjected to sexual
  violence by persons other than an intimate partner in the previous 12 months,
  by age and place of occurrence
CONTACT_ORGANISATION: Bureau of Justice Statistics
STAT_CONC_DEF: >-
  The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) measures the number and rate of
  violent victimizations involving females age 12 or older in the previous 12
  months by victim-offender relationship. The following categories are available
  for victim-offender relationship in the National Crime Victimization Survey
  Data Dashboard: Intimate partners (i.e., current or former spouses,
  boyfriends, and girlfriends), Other relatives (i.e., parents, step-parents,
  children, step-children, brothers, sisters, and other relatives),
  Well-known/casual acquaintances (i.e., friends or former friends, roommates or
  boarders, schoolmates, neighbors, people at work, and other known
  nonrelatives), Strangers (i.e., anyone not previously known by the victim),
  Don’t know relationship, and Don’t know number of off enders. Data for this
  indicator includes crimes where the victim and offender were other relatives,
  well-known/casual acquaintances, or strangers.


  Sexual violence includes rape and sexual assault. The NCVS defines rape as
  coerced or forced sexual intercourse. Forced sexual intercourse means vaginal,
  anal, or oral penetration by the offender(s). This category could include
  incidents where the penetration was from a foreign object such as a bottle. It
  includes attempted rape, threatened rape, and incidents involving victims and
  offenders who are the same sex or different sexes. Attempted rape includes
  verbal threats of rape. Sexual assault encompasses a wide range of
  victimizations, separate from rape or attempted rape. Includes attacks or
  attempted attacks generally involving unwanted sexual contact between victim
  and offender, with or without force. Includes grabbing or fondling and verbal
  threats. For NCVS reporting, rape and sexual assault are combined into one
  victimization measure.

  The NCVS is administered to persons age 12 or older from a nationally
  representative sample of U.S. households. It collects information on nonfatal
  personal crimes (rape or sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, simple
  assault, and personal larceny (purse snatching and pocket picking)) and
  household property crimes (burglary or trespassing, motor vehicle theft, and
  other types of theft). The survey collects information on threatened,
  attempted, and completed crimes. Survey respondents provide information about
  themselves (including age, sex, race, Hispanic origin, marital status,
  education level, and income) and whether they experienced a victimization. For
  each victimization incident, respondents report information about the offender
  (including age, sex, race, Hispanic origin, and victim-off ender
  relationship), characteristics of the crime (including time and place of
  occurrence, use of weapons, nature of injury, and economic consequences),
  whether the crime was reported to police, reasons the crime was or was not
  reported, and experiences with the criminal justice system. As the NCVS is
  based on a nationally representative sample, the indicator is subject to
  sampling error. For more information on the sample size and response rates see
  https://bjs.ojp.gov/data-collection/ncvs


  NCVS data can be used to produce several types of estimates, including
  victimization, incident, and prevalence rates. Data for this indicator are
  based on victimization estimates, which are reported as either the number or
  rate of violent victimizations. Victimization data are not reported as a
  proportion of the population, whereas incident and prevalence estimates are.
  Therefore, the data for this indicator are reported as the rate of sexual
  victimizations by persons other than an intimate partner per 1,000 specified
  population (females age 12 or older). Further breakdowns by age and location
  are not available. 


  Estimates for 2006 cannot be compared to other years. See Criminal
  Victimization, 2007 (NCJ 224390, BJS, December 2008),
  https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv07.pdf, for more information on changes
  to the 2006 National Crime Victimization Survey.
DATA_COMP: >-
  NCVS victimization rates are estimated by dividing the number of
  victimizations that occur during a 12 month period by the population at risk
  for those victimizations and then multiplying the rate by 1,000. Specifically,
  divide the number of sexual victimizations for females age 12 or older by
  persons other than an intimate partner by the number of females age 12 or
  older in the U.S. and then multiply the rate by 1,000.

periodicity: >-
  The NCVS is a self-report survey that is administered annually from January 1
  to December 31. Annual NCVS estimates are based on the number and
  characteristics of crimes that respondents experienced during the prior 6
  months, excluding the month in which they were interviewed. Therefore, the
  2022 survey covers crimes experienced from July 1, 2021 to November 30, 2022,
  with March 15, 2022 as the middle of the reference period. Crimes are
  classified by the year of the survey and not by the year of the crime.
