  The first round of data collection in the United States (officially known as
  the U.S. PIAAC Main Study) was conducted from August 2011 through April 2012
  with a nationally representative household sample of 5,000 adults between the
  ages of 16 and 65.

  Problem solving in technology-rich environments (PS-TRE) is an innovative
  addition to adult literacy and large-scale assessments. In the  PIAAC PS-TRE
  framework, PS-TRE is defined as: "using digital technology, communication
  tools, and networks to acquire and evaluate information, communicate with
  others, and perform practical tasks." PS-TRE measures skills and abilities
  that are required for solving problems while operating in a technology-rich
  environment. Specifically, it assesses the cognitive processes of problem
  solving—goal setting, planning, selecting, evaluating, organizing, and
  communicating results. The environment in which PS-TRE assesses these
  processes is meant to reflect the reality that digital technology has
  revolutionized access to information and communication capabilities over the
  past decades. In particular, the Internet has immensely increased
  instantaneous access to large amounts of information in multiple formats and
  has expanded capabilities of instant voice, text, visual, and graphic
  communications across the globe.


  In order to effectively operate in this environment, it is necessary to have
  mastery of foundational computer (ICT) skills, including (a) skills associated
  with manipulating input and output devices (e.g., the mouse, keyboard, and
  digital displays), (b) awareness of concepts and knowledge of how the
  environment is structured (e.g., files, folders, scrollbars, hyperlinks, and
  different types of menus or buttons), and (c) the ability to interact
  effectively with digital information (e.g., how to use commands such as save,
  delete, open, close, move, highlight, submit, and send). Such interaction
  involves familiarity with electronic texts, images, graphics and numerical
  data, as well as the ability to locate, evaluate, and critically judge the
  validity, accuracy, and appropriateness of accessed information. These skills
  constitute the core aspects of the PIAAC PS-TRE assessment. Problem Solving in
  Technology-Rich Environments items present tasks of varying difficulty to be
  performed in simulated software applications using commands and functions
  commonly found in the technology environments of email, web pages, and
  spreadsheets. These tasks range from purchasing particular goods or services
  online and finding interactive health information to managing personal
  information and business finances.
