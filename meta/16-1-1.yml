SDG_INDICATOR: "Number of victims of intentional homicide per 100,000 population, by sex and age\t\t"
CONTACT_ORGANISATION: Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program
STAT_CONC_DEF: >-
  Intentional homicide includes murder and nonnegligent manslaughter. The UCR
  defines murder and nonnegligent manslaughter as the willful (nonnegligent)
  killing of one human being by another.

  These tables contain statistics for the entire United States. Because not all
  law enforcement agencies provide data for complete reporting periods, the
  Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) estimated crime numbers for some
  agencies. The FBI computes estimates for participating agencies that do not
  provide 12 months of complete data. For agencies supplying 3 to 11 months of
  data, the national Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program estimates for the
  missing data by following a standard estimation procedure using the data
  provided by the agency. If an agency has supplied less than 3 months of data,
  the FBI computes estimates by using the known crime figures of similar areas
  within a state and assigning the same proportion of crime volumes to
  nonreporting agencies. The estimation process considers the following:
  population size covered by the agency; type of jurisdiction, e.g., police
  department versus sheriff ’s office; and geographic location. Data on sex and
  age of victim are obtained by the FBI through the Supplemental Homicide
  Reports and National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS).


  For the 2021 collection year, the FBI’s UCR Program transitioned from the
  traditional Summary Reporting System (SRS) to the more comprehensive NIBRS. A
  significant number of agencies were unable to complete the transition to NIBRS
  in 2021. Due to the lower volume of participation, the FBI was unable to
  produce the traditional national estimates for that year. Because SRS data was
  not directly collected by the FBI, in order to compile estimates for 2021, the
  FBI has since gathered a sampling of 2021 SRS data to augment the information
  collected via NIBRS and compile reliable estimates. For the 2022 collection
  year, the FBI resumed collecting SRS data from agencies that had not yet
  transitioned to NIBRS to supplement the 2022 NIBRS data collection. The FBI
  will assess the level of NIBRS transition yearly and continue to accept SRS
  data until it is no longer needed.


  Only intentional homicide rates for the entire U.S. population are available.
  Number of intentional homicides by sex is also provided. Number of intentional
  homicides by age and sex are only available for certain years (2013-2020) and
  are not provided here but can be accessed through the United Nations Office on
  Drugs and Crime data dashboard:
  https://dataunodc.un.org/dp-intentional-homicide-victims
DATA_COMP: >-
  The homicide rate, defined as the number of offenses per 100,000 population,
  is derived by first dividing the nation’s population by 100,000 and then
  dividing the number of offenses by the resulting figure.
