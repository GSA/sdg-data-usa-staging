SDG_INDICATOR: >-
  Proportion of population subjected to (a) physical violence, (b) psychological
  violence and/or (c) sexual violence in the previous 12 months

  Prevalence reflects the number or percentage of unique persons who were
  victims of crime at least once during a given period. The National Crime
  Victimization Survey (NCVS) measures the percent of persons age 12 or older
  that experienced one or more violent crimes in the previous 12 months. Violent
  crime includes physical violence (robbery, aggravated assault, and simple
  assault) and sexual violence (rape and sexual assault). The NCVS does not
  measure psychological violence.
UNIT_MEASURE: Percent of unique victims of violent crime in the specified population
SOURCE_TYPE: National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS)
DATA_SOURCE: Bureau of Justice Statistics
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  The NCVS is administered to persons age 12 or older from a nationally
  representative sample of U.S. households. It collects information on nonfatal
  personal crimes (rape or sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, simple
  assault, and personal larceny (purse snatching and pocket picking)) and
  household property crimes (burglary or trespassing, motor vehicle theft, and
  other types of theft). The survey collects information on threatened,
  attempted, and completed crimes. It collects data both on crimes reported and
  not reported to police. Unless specified otherwise, estimates in this report
  include threatened, attempted, and completed crimes. For more information on
  the sample size and response rates see
  https://bjs.ojp.gov/data-collection/ncvs


  Estimates for 2006 cannot be compared to other years. See Criminal
  Victimization, 2007 (NCJ 224390, BJS, December 2008),
  https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv07.pdf,  for more information on changes
  to the 2006 National Crime Victimization Survey.


  As the NCVS is based on a nationally representative sample, the indicator is
  subject to sampling error. The national estimate in 2022 had a standard error
  of 0.042%. For other years, see Criminal Victimization, 2022 (NCJ 307089, BJS,
  September 2023), https://bjs.ojp.gov/document/cv22.pdf
DATA_COMP: >-
  Prevalence rates are estimated by dividing the number of unique victims in the
  specified population by the total number of persons in the population and
  multiplying the rate by 100, yielding the percentage of the population
  victimized at least once in a period.

  The NCVS is a self-report survey that is administered annually from January 1
  to December 31. Annual NCVS estimates are based on the number and
  characteristics of crimes that respondents experienced during the prior 6
  months, excluding the month in which they were interviewed. Therefore, the
  2022 survey covers crimes experienced from July 1, 2021 to November 30, 2022,
  with March 15, 2022 as the middle of the reference period. Crimes are
  classified by the year of the survey and not by the year of the crime.
