  Number of facilities with essential medicines in stock / Total number of
  health facilities


  Method of measurement


  Stock out data may also refer to specific time period (1 month, 3 months).
  Data on the availability of a specific list of medicines are collected from a
  survey of a sample of facilities. Availability is reported as the percentage
  of medicine outlets where a particular medicine was found on the day of the
  survey. Health facility reports may also include stockouts indicators but
  require regular independent verification.
