  Rail passenger-kilometer data are Amtrak only.  Commuter rail, light rail and
  subways are included under transit.  Amtrak data are a sum of the
  passenger-kilometer data for the twelve months of each calendar year.  Air
  passenger-kilometer data are for certified air carriers in domestic service.
DATA_COMP: >-
  Passenger data – number of passengers multiplied by the distance traveled.
  Freight data – the Freight Analysis Framework incorporates data from the 2012
  Commodity Flow Survey, Transborder Freight Data, Foreign Trade Statistics, and
  a combination of sources for individual sectors including agriculture, energy
  extraction, construction, and other sectors. Both passenger and freight data
  have been converted to metric units.
