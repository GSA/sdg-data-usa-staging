SDG_INDICATOR: >-
  Percent of persons ages 18 and older who report feeling safe walking near
  their home
CONTACT_ORGANISATION: Gallup Inc.
STAT_CONC_DEF: >-
  Respondents are asked to answer: "Is there any area near where you live - that
  is, within a mile - where you would be afraid to walk alone at night?"
  (yes/no)
UNIT_MEASURE: Percent (%) reporting no to the question above
SOURCE_TYPE: 'Gallup Inc.''s Crime Survey '
DATA_SOURCE: Gallup Inc. (data provided by the Bureau of Justice Statistics)
REC_USE_LIM: >-
  The results are based on telephone interviews with a random sample of
  approximately 1,000 adults (age 18+) living in all 50 U.S. states and the
  District of Columbia. Each year, the margin of error is approximately +/- 4
  percentage points at the 95% confidence level. Interviews are conducted with
  respondents on landline telephones and cellular phones, with interviews
  conducted in Spanish for respondents who are primarily Spanish-speaking. Each
  sample of national adults includes a minimum quota of cell phone respondents
  and landline respondents that vary by data year (e.g., 2018: 50% cell and 50%
  landline; 2023: 80% cell and 20% landline), with additional minimum quotas by
  time zone within region. Landline and cell phone telephone numbers are
  selected using random digit dial methods. Landline respondents are chosen at
  random within each household on the basis of which member has the next
  birthday. Data were not collected in 2022. 


  Samples are weighted to correct for unequal selection probability,
  non-response, and double coverage of landline and cell users in the two
  sampling frames. They are also weighted to match the national demographics of
  gender, age, race, Hispanic ethnicity, education, region, population density,
  and phone status (cell phone-only/landline only/both and cell phone mostly).
  Demographic weighting targets are based on the most recent Current Population
  Survey figures for the aged 18 and older U.S. population. Phone status targets
  are based on the most recent National Health Interview Survey. Population
  density targets are based on the decennial census. All reported margins of
  sampling error include the computed design effects for weighting.
DATA_COMP: >-
  The percent of persons feeling safe walking near their home is computed as the
  number of weighted responses answering "no" divided by the total number of
  weighted responses (yes + no + refused) and multiplying the resulting figure
  by 100. Similar methods are done for sex (e.g., (males reporting "no" / total
  male respondents) *100). All percents are rounded to the nearest whole number.
