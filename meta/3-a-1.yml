  Age-adjusted rates are for the US population 18 years and older, not for 15
  years and older. They are age-adjusted using the 2000 US standard population. 
DATA_COMP: >-
  The age-adjusted rate of persons who are daily smokers is based on responses
  to two questions from the National Health Interview Survey: “Have you smoked
  at least 100 cigarettes in your entire life?” and “Do you now smoke cigarettes
  every day, some days, or not at all?” Daily smokers are adults who have smoked
  100 cigarettes in their lifetime and currently smoke every day.  Percentages
  are generated using sampling survey weights to make nationally representative
  population estimates.
