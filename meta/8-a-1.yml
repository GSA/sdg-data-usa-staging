  Data are extracted from the OECD's Creditor Reporting System (CRS) for
  selected purpose codes that have have been agreed support aid for trade. Aid
  for trade comprises the following categories: - technical assistance for trade
  policy and regulations (e.g. helping countries to develop trade strategies,
  negotiate trade agreements, and implement their outcomes) - trade-related
  infrastructure (e.g. building roads, ports, and telecommunications networks to
  connect domestic markets to the global economy) - productive capacity
  building, including trade development (e.g. supporting the private sector to
  exploit their comparative advantages and diversify their exports)
  trade-related adjustment (e.g. helping developing countries with the costs
  associated with trade liberalisation, such as tariff reductions, preference
  erosion, or declining terms of trade) - other trade-related needs, if
  identified as trade-related development priorities in partner countries'
  national development strategies
