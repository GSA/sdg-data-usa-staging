  Includes students tested with accommodations (1 to 12 percent of all students,

  disabilities and English language learners who were unable to be tested even

DATA_COMP: >-
  The main NAEP reports current information for the nation and specific
  geographic regions of the country. The assessment program includes students
  drawn from a sample from both public and private schools and reports results
  for student achievement at grades 4, 8, and 12. The main NAEP assessments
  follow the frameworks developed by the National Assessment Governing Board and
  use the latest advances in assessment methodology. Because the assessment
  items reflect curricula associated with specific grade levels, the main NAEP
  uses samples of students at those grade levels.
