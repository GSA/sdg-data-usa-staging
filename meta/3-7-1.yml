  Estimates can only be made periodically. Estimates shown represent the
  midpoint of the time period of the survey used to produce the data. Between
  2000 and 2006, the NSFG was only administered once, in 2002. Since 2006, the
  survey has been administered continuously, but data are produced in 2-year
  cycles. Between 2006 and 2015, two 4-year estimates are provided, representing
  the midpoint of 4-years of data (2008 and 2013).  Estimates since 2015 are
  provided, representing the midpoint of 2 years of data (2016 and 2018).

  (not at a specific act of sexual intercourse) among female participants aged

  estimates are produced using sample survey weights.
