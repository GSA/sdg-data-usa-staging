  The US CDC is not able to report.  The only cases in the US are related to
  travel and there are very few.
DATA_COMP: >-
  Number of malaria cases / Population at risk (number of people living in areas
  where malaria transmission occurs)


  Method of measurement


  Complete data on malaria cases reported through surveillance systems are the
  best source of data but are rarely available for large populations. Reported
  data on malaria cases generally need to be corrected for extent of health
  service use, incompleteness of reporting and lack of case confirmation. In
  high transmission areas with limited health service data but with good data on
  parasite prevalence the number of cases can be estimated from parasite
  prevalence. The denominator is estimated, using risk mapping and population
  data.


  Method of estimation


  WHO compiles data on reported confirmed cases of malaria, submitted by
  national malaria control programmes and estimates the extent of
  underreporting. Where necessary the number of cases are inferred from parasite
  prevalence surveys.
