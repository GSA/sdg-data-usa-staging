  Develop a country score card that assesses and tracks progress on the extent
  to which national urban policy (development and implementation) satisfies the
  following criteria as qualifiers, based on participation, partnership,
  coordination and cooperation of actors:


  1. responds to population dynamics

  2. ensures balanced regional and territorial development

  3. prepares for infrastructure and services development

  4. promotes urban land-use efficiency

  5. enhances resilience to climate change

  6. protects public space

  7. develops effective urban governance systems

  8. Increase local fiscal space


  This indicator places particular emphasis on the aspect of national and
  regional development planning and the notion of inclusion of sectors and
  actors, articulated on national urban policies (NUP). The indicator has
  various key qualifiers that are scored between 0-5 (0-none, and 5 for full
  compliance). Tools to be used to support the reporting on this indicator
  include: baseline, benchmarking, point-of-service surveys, scorecard,
  peer-review and experts opinion, performance monitoring and reporting, focus
  group discussions, gap and content analysis. With initial support of
  UN-Habitat and partners tracking and assessment tools and methods will be
  developed, piloted and rolled out at country level to assess national urban
  policies developed and implemented based on the qualifiers listed above. Based
  on expert opinion, the assessment of the qualifiers of the indicator will
  target national government institutions as well as other key urban
  stakeholders from academia, private sector, and civil society organization, as
  per specific criteria of selection of these stakeholders. A threshold will be
  established to ascertain the level of satisfaction of each qualifier. The
  method for tracking and analysing progress on national urban policies will
  collate information on adopted policies, conventions, laws, government
  programs, and other initiatives that comprise an urban policy. This
  information would be in most cases already available. The analysis will cover
  the qualifiers listed above. The standard definition of National Urban Policy5
  will be extended and adapted to country context and may include where
  applicable terms such as National Urban Plan, Frameworks, Strategies, etc. as
  long as they are aligned with the above qualifiers.


  For each of the 8 items defined above, policies will be scored on a scale of 1
  to 5 for achievement or lack of achievement. Overall aggregate national scores
  (X) will range from 8 to 40 and these will be standardized to the scale of
  0-100 using the following approach. If (X) is the observed aggregate value of
  the score for the policy performance using the above criterion, then its
  standardized value X(S) will be computed as; X(s) = 100 ( (X - Min(X) / Max(X)
  - Min(X) ) Where, Max (X) and Min (X) are the maximum and minimum values
  observed for X which is 8 and 40, respectively. Countries that achieve maximum
  values on the scorecard i.e. Max (X) =40, the value assigned via
  standardization will be 100 while those that achieve minimum score i.e. Min
  (X) =8 the value assigned via standardization will be 0. Unit:
  Number/dimensionless Number of countries which have scored above the threshold
  and are making progress on the range of qualifiers. When analysing the data
  and the score card, the scorecard of each country could be used to ascertain
  the overall performance of countries which could then be aggregated by
  regional groups and specific qualifiers. The scorecard will point to concrete
  policy recommendations, particularly for qualifiers that need particular
  attention.
