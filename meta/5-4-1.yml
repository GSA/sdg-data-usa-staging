  Data are from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS), which is nationally
  representative of the U.S. civilian noninstitutional population age 15 and
  over. Individuals are selected from households that have completed the 8th
  month of the Current Population Survey. Each selected individual is
  interviewed one time, by telephone, about how they spent their time on one
  day. Individuals have been interviewed for the ATUS on nearly every day since
  the survey began in 2003. For information about ATUS methods, see the BLS
  Handbook of Methods:  https://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/atus/home.htm. Data are
  estimates of average hours per day (see formula in section 7.4 of the ATUS
  User's Guide:  https://www.bls.gov/tus/atususersguide.pdf).
