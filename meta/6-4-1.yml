  The indicator is disaggregated by sector, in order to allow for different
  metrics in different sectors. Water efficiency in irrigated agriculture is
  calculated as the agricultural value added per agricultural (net) water
  withdrawn, expressed in USD/m3. In formula:


  Awe = GVAa x (1-Cr)Va-Ra


  Where:


  * Awe = Irrigated agriculture water efficiency [USD/m3]

  * GVAa = Gross value added by agriculture (excluding river and marine
  fisheries and forestry)[USD]

  * Cr = Proportion of agricultural GVA produced by rainfed agriculture [-]

  * Va =  Volume of water withdrawn by the agricultural sector (including
  irrigation, livestock and aquaculture) [m3]

  * Ra = Volume of water returned to the hydrologic system (return flow) [m3] 


  The volume of water withdrawn by the agricultural sectors (V) is collected at
  country level through national records and reported in questionnaires, in
  units of km3/year or million m3/year (see example in AQUASTAT
  http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/sets/aq-5yr-quest_eng.xls). Agricultural
  value added in national currency is obtained from national statistics,
  converted to USD and deflated to the baseline year 2015. The Cr coefficient
  can be estimated as Cr= 37%, on the basis of the general FAO assumption on the
  ratio between rainfed and irrigated yield. More detailed estimations are
  however possible and encouraged at country level. Water efficiency of
  industries is calculated as the industrial value added per unit of industrial
  (net) water withdrawn, and expressed in USD/m3. In formula:


  Iwe = GVAiVi-Ri


  Where:


  * Iwe = Irrigated water efficiency [USD/m3]

  * GVAi = Gross value added by industry (excluding energy)[USD]

  * Vi =  Volume of water withdrawn by the industries (excluding energy) [m3]

  * Ri = Volume of water returned to the hydrologic system (return flow) [m3]


  Industrial water withdrawal (V) is collected at country level through national
  records and reported in questionnaires, in units of km3/year or million
  m3/year (see example in AQUASTAT
  http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/sets/aq-5yr-quest_eng.xls). Industrial
  value added is obtained from national statistics, deflated to the baseline
  year 2015. Energy (power) water efficiency is calculated as the value added of
  power production per unit of (net) water withdrawn for energy production, and
  expressed in MWh/m3. In formula:


  Ewe = TEPVe-Re


  Where:


  * Ewe = Energy water efficiency [MWh/m3]

  * TEP = Total energy production [MWh]

  * Ve =  Volume of water withdrawn for energy production, i.e. for the cooling
  of power plants (including evaporation from reservoirs created behind dams for
  hydropower) [m3]

  * Re = Volume of water returned to the hydrologic system (return flow) [m3]


  Volume of water withdrawn for energy production (V) is collected at country
  level through national records and reported in questionnaires, in units of
  km3/year or million m3/year (see example in AQUASTAT
  http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/sets/aq-5yr-quest_eng.xls). Value added
  of electricity production is obtained from national statistics, deflated to
  the baseline year 2015. Municipal water supply efficiency is the ratio between
  water effectively distributed to the municipal users and the water withdrawn
  for municipal use by water supply utilities (i.e. distribution efficiency,
  size of network losses). In formula:


  Mwe = MudVm


  Where:


  * Mwe = Municipal water supply efficiency [-]

  * Mud = Water distributed to municipal users [m3]

  * Vm = Volume of water withdrawn by municipal utilities (i.e. the public
  distribution network) [m3]


  Data on volumes of withdrawn and distributed are collected at country level
  from the municipal supply utilities records.
