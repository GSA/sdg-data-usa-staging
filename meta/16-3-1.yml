  The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) measures the number and rate of
  violent victimizations in the previous 12 months for persons age 12 or older.
  The NCVS also collects information on whether these crimes were reported or
  not reported to police and on the reasons why the crime was reported or not
  reported. Violent crime includes physical violence (robbery, aggravated
  assault, and simple assault) and sexual violence (rape and sexual assault).
  The NCVS does not measure psychological violence.

  The NCVS is administered to persons age 12 or older from a nationally
  representative sample of U.S. households. It collects information on nonfatal
  personal crimes (rape or sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, simple
  assault, and personal larceny (purse snatching and pocket picking)) and
  household property crimes (burglary or trespassing, motor vehicle theft, and
  other types of theft). The survey collects information on threatened,
  attempted, and completed crimes. Survey respondents provide information about
  themselves (including age, sex, race, Hispanic origin, marital status,
  education level, and income) and whether they experienced a victimization. For
  each victimization incident, respondents report information about the off
  ender (including age, sex, race, Hispanic origin, and victim-off ender
  relationship), characteristics of the crime (including time and place of
  occurrence, use of weapons, nature of injury, and economic consequences),
  whether the crime was reported to police, reasons the crime was or was not
  reported, and experiences with the criminal justice system. For more
  information on the sample size and response rates see
  https://bjs.ojp.gov/data-collection/ncvs


  NCVS data can be used to produce several types of estimates, including
  victimization, incident, and prevalence rates. Data for this indicator are
  based on victimization estimates. 


  As the NCVS is based on a nationally representative sample, the indicator is
  subject to sampling error. The national estimate in 2022 had a standard error
  of 1.83%. For other years, see National Crime Victimization Survey Data
  Dashboard: https://ncvs.bjs.ojp.gov/Home
DATA_COMP: >-
  Number of violent crime incidents reported to police or other authorities
  divided by the number of violent crime incidents during the previous 12-month
  period and multiplied by 100, yielding the percentage of the violent
  victimizations reported to police.

periodicity: >-
  The NCVS is a self-report survey that is administered annually from January 1
  to December 31. Annual NCVS estimates are based on the number and
  characteristics of crimes that respondents experienced during the prior 6
  months, excluding the month in which they were interviewed. Therefore, the
  2022 survey covers crimes experienced from July 1, 2021 to November 30, 2022,
  with March 15, 2022 as the middle of the reference period. Crimes are
  classified by the year of the survey and not by the year of the crime.
