  Pounds of food waste per person were sent to landfill, controlled combustion,
  sewer, co/anaerobic digestion, compost/aerobic digestion, and land
  application, from the following sectors:  food retail, food service, and
  households.

  There are some data limitations associated with EPA’s estimates. EPA relies on
  existing studies and data to develop generation factors, and for some sectors,
  there are few existing studies. In addition, as states and cities adopt
  landfill bans and recycling mandates, estimates that rely heavily on studies
  that pre-date those laws may result in overestimation of generation,
  especially as these laws become more common and continue to be implemented. On
  the management pathway side, composting and anaerobic digestion tonnages may
  be underestimated, as EPA did not extrapolate to account for states and
  facilities for which no data was found. Food donation may be overestimated due
  to EPA’s approach to accounting for food being donated to food banks not in
  the Feeding America network. Data for food being sent down the drain to the
  sewer system is limited.

  Generation estimates rely on studies conducted by state and municipal
  governments, industry groups, universities, and other groups that measure
  wasted food generated at facilities in various sectors. Estimates are
  correlated to facility-specific characteristics (e.g., revenue or the number
  of employees) to establish equations expressing generation factors (e.g.,
  4,080 lbs of wasted food generated/employee/year in supermarkets). There are
  multiple studies, and therefore multiple generation factors, available for
  most sectors. EPA scaled up these rates by applying national, sector-specific
  statistics (e.g., U.S. Census-reported store sales, number of employees in
  restaurants, number of patients in hospitals, number of inmates in
  correctional facilities), which resulted in multiple generation estimates per
  sector. An average annual generation estimate was then calculated for each
  sector, and these values were summed to calculate overall estimates of excess
  food and food waste generated nationally.

  The initial management pathway analysis drew on sector-specific literature
  that provided a percentage distribution across the management pathways (i.e.,
  an estimate of the percent of wasted food destined for each major management
  pathway by generating sector. EPA then took into account bottom up data on
  food banks, AD and composting and adjusted the initial management pathway
  estimates.
