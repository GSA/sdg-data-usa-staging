REC_USE_LIM: >-
  Rates were generated by CDC Wonder using the Underlying Cause of Death
  mortality files. Rates were selected based on the ICD-10 113 Cause of Death
  listing.
DATA_COMP: >-
  The age-adjusted rate is calculated as the number of deaths due to combined
  causes as identified by ICD-10 codes C00-C97 (malignant neoplasms), E10-E14
  (diabetes mellitus), I00-I78 (major cardiovascular disease) and J40-J47
  (chronic lower respiratory diseases) divided by the US population.  Rates are
  age-adjusted to the US 2000 standard population using the direct method of
  applying age-specific death rates to the U.S. standard population
  distribution. See http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Age-Adjusted
  Rates for more detail.
