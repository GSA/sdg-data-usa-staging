  Using data gathered from industry associations, businesses and government
  sources, such as the U.S.

  Department of Commerce and the U.S. Census Bureau, EPA estimates the weight in
  tons of all MSW materials

  and products generated, recycled, composted, managed by other methods for
  food, combusted with energy

  recovery and landfilled. Other sources of data, such as waste
  characterizations and research reports performed

  by governments, industry or the press, supplement these data.
