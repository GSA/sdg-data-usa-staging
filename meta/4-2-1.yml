DATA_COMP: Scale scores as described in indicators description
actual_indicator_available_description: "The approaches to learning scale is based on teachers' reports on how students rate in seven areas: attentiveness, task persistence, eagerness to learn, learning independence, ability to adapt easily to changes in routine, organization, and ability to follow classroom rules. Possible scores on the approaches to learning scale range from 1 to 4, with higher scores indicating that a child exhibits positive learning behaviors more often.\n\nThe interpersonal skills scale is based on teachers' reports on the student’s skill in forming and maintaining friendships; getting along with people who are different; comforting or helping other children; expressing feelings, ideas, and opinions in positive ways; and showing sensitivity to the feelings of others. Possible scores on the interpersonal skills scale range from 1 to 4, with higher scores indicating that a child interacted with others in a positive way more often.\n\nThe self-control scale is based on teachers' reports on the student’s ability to control behavior by respecting the property rights of others, controlling temper, accepting peer ideas for group activities, and responding appropriately to pressure from peers. Possible scores on the self-control scale range from 1 to 4, with higher scores indicating that a child exhibited behaviors indicative of self-control more often.\n\nReading score reflects performance on questions measuring basic skills (print familiarity, letter recognition, beginning and ending sounds, rhyming words, and word recognition); vocabulary knowledge; and reading comprehension, including identifying information specifically stated in text (e.g., definitions, facts, and supporting details), making complex inferences from texts, and considering the text objectively and judging its appropriateness and quality. Possible scores for the reading assessment range from 0 to 120.\n\nMathematics score reflects performance on questions on number sense, properties, and operations; measurement; geometry and spatial sense; data analysis, statistics, and probability (measured with a set of simple questions assessing children’s ability to read a graph); and prealgebra skills such as identification of patterns. Possible scores for the mathematics assessment range from 0 to 113.\n\nSocioeconomic status (SES) was measured by a composite score based on parental education and occupations and household income during the child’s kindergarten year.\n\nVariable name | Variable label\n--- | ---\ni4_2_1learnapp_total | Mean approaches to learning score, total\ni4_2_1learnapp_male |Mean approaches to learning score, male\ni4_2_1learnapp_female | Mean approaches to learning score, female\ni4_2_1learnapp_lowses | Mean approaches to learning score, low quintile socioeconomic status\ni4_2_1learnapp_midses | Mean approaches to learning score, middle three quintiles socioeconomic status\ni4_2_1learnapp_highses | Mean approaches to learning score, low quintile socioeconomic status\ni4_2_1interperson_total | Mean interpersonal skills score, total\ni4_2_1interperson_male | Mean interpersonal skills score, male\ni4_2_1interperson_female | Mean interpersonal skills score, female\ni4_2_1interperson_indian | Mean interpersonal skills score, American Indian/Alaska Native\ni4_2_1interperson_lowses | Mean interpersonal skills score, low quintile socioeconomic status\ni4_2_1interperson_midses | Mean interpersonal skills score, middle three quintiles socioeconomic status\ni4_2_1interperson_highses | Mean interpersonal skills score, low quintile socioeconomic status\ni4_2_1control_total | Mean self-control score, total\ni4_2_1control_male | Mean self-control score, male\ni4_2_1control_female | Mean self-control score, female\ni4_2_1control_indian | Mean self-control score, American Indian/Alaska Native\ni4_2_1control_lowses | Mean self-control score, low quintile socioeconomic status\ni4_2_1control_midses | Mean self-control score, middle three quintiles socioeconomic status\ni4_2_1control_highses | Mean self-control score, low quintile socioeconomic status\ni4_2_1reading_total | Mean reading score, total\ni4_2_1reading_male | Mean reading score, male i4_2_1reading_female\t    Mean reading score, female\ni4_2_1reading_indian | Mean reading score, American Indian/Alaska Native\ni4_2_1reading_lowses | Mean reading score, low quintile socioeconomic status\ni4_2_1reading_midses | Mean reading score, middle three quintiles socioeconomic status\ni4_2_1reading_highses | Mean reading score, low quintile socioeconomic status\ni4_2_1math_total | Mean mathematics score, total\ni4_2_1math_male | Mean mathematics score, male\ni4_2_1math_female | Mean mathematics score, female\ni4_2_1math_indian | Mean mathematics score, American Indian/Alaska Native\ni4_2_1math_midses | Mean mathematics score, middle three quintiles socioeconomic status\ni4_2_1math_highses | Mean mathematics score, low quintile socioeconomic status"
