A summary description of definitions and sampling protocols can be found at: http://www.treesearch.fs.fed.us/pubs/20371. The U.S. forest inventory is conducted on a continuous basis, with results compiled periodically, notably the five year compilations published in the Resource Planning Act Assessment (RPA, see: http://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/pubs/gtr/gtr_wo091.pdf),  which are then submitted to UN FAO. The most recent RPA numbers were compiled for 2012 and submitted to UN FAO for their 2015 GFRA report. The next set of RPA numbers will be compiled for 2017 and submitted to FAO for their 2020 GFRA report. Inventory results are sometimes subject to backward revisions, resulting in minor changes to previous period forest area estimates (for this reason, current submissions for SDG 15.1.1 do not exactly match past submissions for Millennium Development Goal 7.1).

In order to provide a precise definition of the indicator, it is crucial to provide a definition of \"Forest\" and \"Total Land Area\". According to the FAO definitions, Forest is defined as \"land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use\". More specifically: \tForest is determined both by the presence of trees and the absence of other predominant land uses. The trees should be able to reach a minimum height of 5 meters. \tIt includes areas with young trees that have not yet reached but which are expected to reach a canopy cover of at least 10 percent and tree height of 5 meters or more. It also includes areas that are temporarily unstocked due to clear-cutting as part of a forest management practice or natural disasters, and which are expected to be regenerated within 5 years. Local conditions may, in exceptional cases, justify that a longer time frame is used. \tIt includes forest roads, firebreaks and other small open areas; forest in national parks, nature reserves and other protected areas such as those of specific environmental, scientific, historical, cultural or spiritual interest. \tIt includes windbreaks, shelterbelts and corridors of trees with an area of more than 0.5 hectares and width of more than 20 meters. \tIt includes abandoned shifting cultivation land with a regeneration of trees that have, or are expected to reach, a canopy cover of at least 10 percent and tree height of at least 5 meters. \tIt includes areas with mangroves in tidal zones, regardless whether this area is classified as land area or not. \tIt includes rubberwood, cork oak and Christmas tree plantations. \tIt includes areas with bamboo and palms provided that land use, height and canopy cover criteria are met. \tIt excludes tree stands in agricultural production systems, such as fruit tree plantations, oil palm plantations, olive orchards and agroforestry systems when crops are grown under tree cover. Note: Some agroforestry systems such as the \"Taungya\" system where crops are grown only during the first years of the forest rotation should be classified as forest. Total land area is the total surface area of a country less the area covered by inland waters, like major rivers and lakes.","indicator_sort_order":"15-01-01","indicator_variable":"pct_forest_totland","international_and_national_references":"UN FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015: Main Report: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.  2016.

Furthermore, gradual changes, such as forest regrowth, require several years to become detectable in satellite imagery.
