The Education 2030 Framework for Action has endorsed a benchmark for this indicator, which encourages countries to allocate at least 15% to 20% of their public expenditure to education.</p>\n<p>While the indicator allows for cross-country comparisons, differences in government structures, budgeting practices, and definitions may limit the comparability of data between countries. Variations in how countries categorize and report spending on education can introduce biases into comparative analyses.</p>\n<p>The indicator does not consider the demographic profile of a country&apos;s population, such as age distribution or socioeconomic status. Countries with younger populations may naturally allocate a higher proportion of spending to education, regardless of government priorities, while countries with aging populations may prioritize other essential services, such as healthcare or social security.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>Total government expenditure for all levels of education combined expressed as a percentage of total general government expenditure (all sectors).</p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <msub>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>P</mi>\n        <mi>X</mi>\n        <mi>E</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </msub>\n    <mo>=</mo>\n    <mfrac>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>T</mi>\n        <msub>\n          <mrow>\n            <mi>X</mi>\n            <mi>E</mi>\n          </mrow>\n          <mrow>\n            <mi>t</mi>\n          </mrow>\n        </msub>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <msub>\n          <mrow>\n            <mi>T</mi>\n            <mi>P</mi>\n            <mi>X</mi>\n          </mrow>\n          <mrow>\n            <mi>t</mi>\n          </mrow>\n        </msub>\n      </mrow>\n    </mfrac>\n  </math></p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <msub>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>P</mi>\n        <mi>X</mi>\n        <mi>E</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </msub>\n  </math> = total general government expenditure on education (all levels of education combined) as a percentage of total government expenditure in financial year <em>t</em></p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <msub>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>T</mi>\n        <mi>X</mi>\n        <mi>E</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </msub>\n  </math> = total general government expenditure on education (all levels of education combined) in financial year <em>t</em></p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <msub>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>T</mi>\n        <mi>P</mi>\n        <mi>X</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </msub>\n  </math> = total general government expenditure in financial year <em>t</em></p>","DATA_VALIDATION__GLOBAL":"<p>The UNESCO Institute for Statistics shares all indicator values and notes on methodology with National Statistical Offices, Ministries of Education, or other relevant agencies in individual countries for their review, feedback and validation before the publication of the data. </p>","ADJUSTMENT__GLOBAL":"<p>Data should cover formal education only and should follow common definitions. </p>","IMPUTATION__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>&#x2022; At country level</strong></p>\n<p>No imputations are made by data compiler.</p>\n<p><strong>&#x2022; At regional and global levels</strong></p>\n<p>Data gaps are filled with latest available value.</p>","REG_AGG__GLOBAL":"<p>Median with coverage equal or higher to 50% of countries.</p>","DOC_METHOD__GLOBAL":"<p>The UIS has elaborated guidance for the countries on the methodology that should be used to calculate this indicator based on the Survey of Formal Education and its manual.
