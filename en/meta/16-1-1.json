Because not all law enforcement agencies provide data for complete reporting periods, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) estimated crime numbers for some agencies. The FBI computes estimates for participating agencies that do not provide 12 months of complete data. For agencies supplying 3 to 11 months of data, the national Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program estimates for the missing data by following a standard estimation procedure using the data provided by the agency. If an agency has supplied less than 3 months of data, the FBI computes estimates by using the known crime figures of similar areas within a state and assigning the same proportion of crime volumes to nonreporting agencies. The estimation process considers the following: population size covered by the agency; type of jurisdiction, e.g., police department versus sheriff \u2019s office; and geographic location. Data on sex and age of victim are obtained by the FBI through the Supplemental Homicide Reports and National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS).\n\nFor the 2021 collection year, the FBI\u2019s UCR Program transitioned from the traditional Summary Reporting System (SRS) to the more comprehensive NIBRS. A significant number of agencies were unable to complete the transition to NIBRS in 2021. Due to the lower volume of participation, the FBI was unable to produce the traditional national estimates for that year. Because SRS data was not directly collected by the FBI, in order to compile estimates for 2021, the FBI has since gathered a sampling of 2021 SRS data to augment the information collected via NIBRS and compile reliable estimates. For the 2022 collection year, the FBI resumed collecting SRS data from agencies that had not yet transitioned to NIBRS to supplement the 2022 NIBRS data collection. The FBI will assess the level of NIBRS transition yearly and continue to accept SRS data until it is no longer needed.\n\nOnly intentional homicide rates for the entire U.S. population are available.

Security from violence is a pre-requisite for individuals to enjoy a safe and active life and for societies and economies to develop freely. Intentional homicides occur in all countries of the world and this indicator has a global applicability.</p>\n<p>Monitoring intentional homicides is necessary to better assess their causes, drivers and consequences and, in the longer term, to develop effective preventive measures. If data are properly disaggregated (as suggested in the International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes), the indicator can identify the different type of violence associated with homicide: inter-personal (including partner and family-related violence), crime (including organized crime and other forms of criminal activities) and socio-political (including terrorism, hate crime).</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>The International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS) provides important clarifications on the definition of intentional homicide.

Less than one half of WHO Member States have well-functioning death-registration systems that record causes of death. </p>\n<p>The fact that homicide data are typically produced by two separate and independent sources at national level (criminal justice and public health) represents a specific asset of this indicator, as the comparison of the two sources is a tool to assess accuracy of national data. Usually, for countries where data from both sources exist, a good level of matching between the sources is recorded (see UNODC Global Study on Homicide, 2013).</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>The indicator is calculated as the total number of victims of intentional homicide recorded in a given year divided by the total resident population in the same year, multiplied by 100,000.</p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <mi>R</mi>\n    <mi>a</mi>\n    <mi>t</mi>\n    <mi>e</mi>\n    <mo>=</mo>\n    <mn>100</mn>\n    <mo>,</mo>\n    <mn>000</mn>\n    <mi>*</mi>\n    <mfrac>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>V</mi>\n        <mi>i</mi>\n        <mi>c</mi>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n        <mi>i</mi>\n        <mi>m</mi>\n        <mi>s</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>P</mi>\n        <mi>o</mi>\n        <mi>p</mi>\n        <mi>u</mi>\n        <mi>l</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n        <mi>i</mi>\n        <mi>o</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </mfrac>\n  </math></p>\n<p>For the rate by sex, the number of victims of that sex should be divided by the population of the same sex. </p>\n<p>In several countries, two separate sets of data on intentional homicide are produced, respectively from criminal justice and public health/civil registration systems.

For each regional aggregate, the number of victims of intentional homicides should correspond to the sum of all national data of such killings in the region, in each year. However, for many countries, data on intentional homicides are not available, or data are available only for some years. As a result, the sample of countries with available data is different for each year. If left unaddressed, this issue would result in inconsistencies, as regional aggregates would be drawn from a different set of countries each year.</p>\n<p>Imputations for intentional homicides victims are performed on the country-level rate of intentional homicide victims per 100,000 population. If a country has just one available data point since the year 2000, all missing values are set equal to this single available data point. This approach therefore accounts for population growth over time and does not mean that the series is constant in absolute terms. If a country has two to eight available data points, the missing values between two data points are estimated by linear interpolation, and if there are missing values that are temporally before (or after) the earliest (or latest) available data point, the values at the beginning (or end) of the series are filled with the earliest (or latest) available data point. If a country has more than eight available data points in the respective time series, the missing values between two data points are estimated by linear interpolation, and if there are missing values that are temporally before (or after) the earliest (or latest) available data point, the values at the end of the time series are imputed using an exponential smoothing approach (for more information, see <a href=\"https://afit-r.github.io/ts_exp_smoothing\">this page</a>).
