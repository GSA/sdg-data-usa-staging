In the  PIAAC PS-TRE framework, PS-TRE is defined as: \"using digital technology, communication tools, and networks to acquire and evaluate information, communicate with others, and perform practical tasks.\" PS-TRE measures skills and abilities that are required for solving problems while operating in a technology-rich environment. Specifically, it assesses the cognitive processes of problem solving\u2014goal setting, planning, selecting, evaluating, organizing, and communicating results. The environment in which PS-TRE assesses these processes is meant to reflect the reality that digital technology has revolutionized access to information and communication capabilities over the past decades. In particular, the Internet has immensely increased instantaneous access to large amounts of information in multiple formats and has expanded capabilities of instant voice, text, visual, and graphic communications across the globe.\n\nIn order to effectively operate in this environment, it is necessary to have mastery of foundational computer (ICT) skills, including (a) skills associated with manipulating input and output devices (e.g., the mouse, keyboard, and digital displays), (b) awareness of concepts and knowledge of how the environment is structured (e.g., files, folders, scrollbars, hyperlinks, and different types of menus or buttons), and (c) the ability to interact effectively with digital information (e.g., how to use commands such as save, delete, open, close, move, highlight, submit, and send). Such interaction involves familiarity with electronic texts, images, graphics and numerical data, as well as the ability to locate, evaluate, and critically judge the validity, accuracy, and appropriateness of accessed information. These skills constitute the core aspects of the PIAAC PS-TRE assessment. Problem Solving in Technology-Rich Environments items present tasks of varying difficulty to be performed in simulated software applications using commands and functions commonly found in the technology environments of email, web pages, and spreadsheets. These tasks range from purchasing particular goods or services online and finding interactive health information to managing personal information and business finances.\n\nVariable name | Variable label\n--- | ---\nI4_4_1_tech_total | PIAAC, problem solving in a technology rich environment, level 2 or higher, total\nI4_4_1_tech_male | PIAAC, problem solving in a technology rich environment, level 2 or higher, male\nI4_4_1_tech_female | PIAAC, problem solving in a technology rich environment, level 2 or higher, female\nI4_4_1_tech_24 | PIAAC, problem solving in a technology rich environment, level 2 or higher, 24 or less\nI4_4_1_tech_34 | PIAAC, problem solving in a technology rich environment, level 2 or higher, 25 to 34\nI4_4_1_tech_44 | PIAAC, problem solving in a technology rich environment, level 2 or higher, 35 to 44\nI4_4_1_tech54 | PIAAC, problem solving in a technology rich environment, level 2 or higher, 45 to 54\nI4_4_1_tech_65 | PIAAC, problem solving in a technology rich environment, level 2 or higher, 55 to 65\nI4_4_1_tech_lowinc | PIAAC, problem solving in a technology rich environment, level 2 or higher, lowest income quartile\nI4_4_1_tech_highinc | PIAAC, problem solving in a technology rich environment, level 2 or higher, highest income quartile","date_of_national_source_publication":"10/2013","periodicity":"One time survey","scheduled_update_by_national_source":"NA","date_metadata_updated":"10/2016","disaggregation_geography":"National","disaggregation_categories":"Sex, age group, and income quartile","international_and_national_references":"http://piaacgateway.com/","time_period":"About every 10 years","scheduled_update_by_SDG_team":"","source_organisation_1":"Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC), 2012","source_agency_staff_name_1":"tom.snyder","source_agency_survey_dataset_1":"Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC), 2012","source_notes_1":"","source_title_1":"","source_url_1":"http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/piaac/ideuspiaac/","source_url_text_1":"http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/piaac/ideuspiaac/","source_organisation_2":"","source_agency_staff_name_2":"","source_agency_survey_dataset_2":"","source_notes_2":"","source_title_2":"","source_url_2":"","source_url_text_2":"","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_non_statistical":false,"data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_title":"Percentage of US persons ages 16 to 65 performing at level 2 or higher of the PIAAC Problem Solving in Technology-Rich Environments","graph_titles":[],"graph_type":"bar","indicator_available":"Percentage of 16- to 65-year-olds performing at PIAAC Problem Solving in Technology-Rich Environments performance level 2 or higher, by sex, age group, and high/low income quartile","indicator_name":"Proportion of youth and adults with information and communications technology (ICT) skills, by type of skill","indicator_number":"4.4.1","national_geographical_coverage":"","page_content":"","permalink":"","precision":[],"reporting_status":"complete","sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"SDG_GOAL__GLOBAL":"<p>Goal 4: Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all</p>","SDG_TARGET__GLOBAL":"<p>Target 4.4: By 2030, substantially increase the number of youth and adults who have relevant skills, including technical and vocational skills, for employment, decent jobs and entrepreneurship</p>","SDG_INDICATOR__GLOBAL":"<p>Indicator 4.4.1: Proportion of youth and adults with information and communications technology (ICT) skills, by type of skill</p>","SDG_SERIES_DESCR__GLOBAL":"<p>SE_ADT_ACTS - Proportion of youth and adults with information and communications technology (ICT) skills [4.4.1]</p>","META_LAST_UPDATE__GLOBAL":"2024-05-24","SDG_RELATED_INDICATORS__GLOBAL":"<p>4.5.1, 9.c.1, 17.6.1, 17.8.1 </p>","SDG_CUSTODIAN_AGENCIES__GLOBAL":"<p>International Telecommunication Union (ITU)</p>","CONTACT_ORGANISATION__GLOBAL":"<p>International Telecommunication Union (ITU)</p>","STAT_CONC_DEF__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>\n<p>The proportion of youth and adults with Information and Communications Technology (ICT) skills, by type of skill defined as the percentage of individuals that have undertaken certain ICT-related activities in the last 3 months.
