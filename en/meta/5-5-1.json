They may participate as voters, candidates for local, regional and national elections, members of parliament or local council, heads of state and government, ministers, members of political parties, trade unions or business associations, or as electoral administrators. \nCapturing an accurate assessment of women's representation across these different forms of political participation has been difficult, however. The standard measure of women's political participation and involvement in decision-making, used to track progress for the Millennium Development Goals, was the proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments. In many respects, the existence and quality of this data has meant that other areas of political participation have not been paid sufficient attention. \nMeasuring women's participation in local government is an additional, but equally important measure of women's political participation and decision-making, because of the responsibilities of local governments and the significantly higher number of opportunities (that is seats) available to women candidates at this level. Women's entry into local politics has the potential to influence a wide range of policy decisions and local community programmes. \nHowever, the available data is limited; it is neither comprehensive across all countries, nor regularly updated. Data from the United Nations Statistical Division's 2010 edition of The World's Women, for example, show selected regional averages, with a low of 8 percent in Northern Africa to a high of 30 percent in sub-Saharan Africa. Averages across Latin America and Europe ranged from 24 to 29 percent and Asia reported averages below 20 percent. Drawing meaningful conclusions from this data is therefore difficult. \nIn 1995, the Beijing Platform for Action called on governments to accept a wider understanding of women's participation in decision-making that went beyond women in national politics. The 20-year review of the Platform, however, found that: \n\ta significant challenge for effectively monitoring progress towards gender equality is the lack of high quality and comparable data, collected over time. Many areas of statistics that are of critical importance such as ' women's participation in decision-making at all levels, including local government ' are still not produced regularly by countries. Data and statistical requirements for the post-2015 development agenda will be substantial, particularly for monitoring gender equality, women's empowerment and the human rights of women and girls in the new framework. \nA dedicated indicator on women's political participation would provide the necessary 'data mandate' to ensure this data set is more systematically collected across all countries and regularly monitored over time, allowing for both international and longitudinal comparisons.","reporting_status":"complete","sdg_goal":5,"source_active_1":true,"source_agency_staff_email_1":"FN-OMB-OIRA-SDGs@omb.eop.gov","source_agency_staff_name_1":"Kali Kong","source_agency_survey_dataset_1":"http://www.cawp.rutgers.edu/women-us-congress-2018","source_notes_1":null,"source_organisation_1":"http://www.cawp.rutgers.edu/women-us-congress-2018","source_title_1":null,"source_url_1":"http://history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and-Publications/WIC/Historical-Data/Women-Representatives-and-Senators-by-Congress/","source_url_text_1":"http://history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and-Publications/WIC/Historical-Data/Women-Representatives-and-Senators-by-Congress/","target":"Ensure women's full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision-making in political, economic and public life","target_id":"5.5","title":"Proportion of seats held by women in (a) national parliaments and (b) local governments","un_custodial_agency":"IPU, UN Women (Partnering Agencies: World Bank)","un_designated_tier":"1 (a) 2 (b)","variable_description":null,"variable_notes":null,"page_content":"","national_metadata_updated_date":"2024-07-08","national_data_updated_date":"2024-06-06","composite_breakdown_label":"","computation_units":"","copyright":"","data_footnote":"","data_notice_class":"","data_notice_heading":"","data_notice_text":"","data_show_map":false,"data_start_values":[],"embedded_feature_footer":"","embedded_feature_html":"","embedded_feature_tab_title":"","embedded_feature_title":"","embedded_feature_url":"","expected_disaggregations":[],"graph_annotations":[],"graph_limits":[],"graph_stacked_disaggregation":"","graph_titles":[],"indicator_number":"5.5.1","permalink":"","precision":[],"sort":"","standalone":false,"tags":[],"SDG_GOAL__GLOBAL":"<p>Goal 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls</p>","SDG_TARGET__GLOBAL":"<p>Target 5.5: Ensure women&#x2019;s full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision-making in political, economic and public life</p>","SDG_INDICATOR__GLOBAL":"<p>Indicator 5.5.1: Proportion of seats held by women in (a) national parliaments and (b) local governments</p>","SDG_SERIES_DESCR__GLOBAL":"<p>SG_GEN_PARL - Proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments (% of total number of seats) [5.5.1]</p>\n<p>SG_GEN_PARLN - Number of seats held by women in national parliaments [5.5.1]</p>\n<p>SG_GEN_PARLNT - Current number of seats in national parliaments [5.5.1]</p>","META_LAST_UPDATE__GLOBAL":"2023-12-15","SDG_RELATED_INDICATORS__GLOBAL":"<p>Indicator 16.7.1: Proportions of positions (by age group, sex, persons with disabilities and population groups) in public institutions (national and local), including (a) the legislatures; (b) the public service; and (c) the judiciary, compared to national distributions.</p>","SDG_CUSTODIAN_AGENCIES__GLOBAL":"<p>Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU)</p>","CONTACT_ORGANISATION__GLOBAL":"<p>Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU)</p>","STAT_CONC_DEF__GLOBAL":"<p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>\n<p>The proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments, currently as of 1 January of reporting year, is currently measured as the number of seats held by women members in single or lower chambers of national parliaments, expressed as a percentage of all occupied seats.</p>\n<p>National parliaments can be bicameral or unicameral.

After each general election or renewal, a questionnaire is dispatched to parliaments to solicit the latest available data.

It was founded in 1889 as the first multilateral political organization in the world, encouraging cooperation and dialogue between all nations. Today, the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) comprises 179 national Member Parliaments and 13 regional parliamentary bodies. It promotes democracy and helps parliaments become stronger, younger, gender-balanced, and more diverse. </p>\n<p>The IPU recognizes gender equality as a key component of democracy. It works to achieve equal participation of men and women in politics and supports parliaments in advancing gender equality. This includes the collection and dissemination of quantitative and qualitative data on women in politics. In particular, the IPU has tracked the percentage of women in national parliaments since 1945 and is the authority for this data. See historical and comparative data on women in parliament at <a href=\"https://data.ipu.org/historical-women\">https://data.ipu.org/historical-women</a>. </p>","RATIONALE__GLOBAL":"<p>The indicator measures the degree to which women have equal access to parliamentary decision-making. Women&#x2019;s participation in parliaments is a key aspect of women&#x2019;s opportunities in political and public life and is linked to women&#x2019;s empowerment. Equal numbers of women and men in lower chambers would give an indicator value of 50 percent.</p>\n<p>A stronger presence of women in parliament allows new concerns to be highlighted on political agendas, and new priorities to be put into practice through the adoption and implementation of policies and laws. The inclusion of the perspectives and interests of women is a prerequisite for democracy and gender equality and contributes to good governance. A representative parliament also allows the different experiences of men and women to affect the social, political, and economic future of societies.</p>\n<p>Changes in the indicator have been tracked over time. Although the international community has supported and promoted women&#x2019;s participation in political decision-making structures for several decades, improvement in women&#x2019;s access to parliament has been slow. This has led to the introduction of special policies and legal measures to increase women&#x2019;s shares of parliamentary seats in several countries. Those countries that have adopted special measures generally have greater representation of women in parliament than countries without special measures.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>- The number of countries covered varies with suspensions or dissolutions of parliaments. As of 1 February 2016, 193 countries are included.</p>\n<p>- There can be difficulties in obtaining information on by-election results and replacements due to death or resignation. These changes are ad hoc events that are more difficult to keep track of. By-elections, for instance, are often not announced internationally as general elections are.</p>\n<p>- The data excludes the numbers and percentages of women in the upper chambers of parliament. The information is available on the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) website at <a href=\"https://data.ipu.org/women-ranking\">https://data.ipu.org/women-ranking</a>.</p>\n<p>- Parliaments vary considerably in their internal workings and procedures, however, generally legislate, oversee government and represent the electorate. In terms of measuring women&#x2019;s contribution to political decision-making, this indicator may not be sufficient because some women may face obstacles in fully and efficiently carrying out their parliamentary mandate.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>The proportion of seats held by women in the national parliament is derived by dividing the total number of seats occupied by women by the total number of seats in parliament.</p>\n<p>There is no weighting or normalising of statistics.</p>","DATA_VALIDATION__GLOBAL":"<p>Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) member parliaments provide information on changes and updates to the IPU secretariat via IPU Groups within each parliamentary chamber or via the Parline Correspondent&#x2019;s Network. </p>\n<p>Parline Correspondents are staff members of national parliaments who act as the IPU focal point for IPU&#x2019;s Parline database within each chamber or parliament.
