WHO air quality guidelines provide specific recommendations on the mean levels of fine particulate matter which can support measuring the per capita health impacts related to any improvements or degradation in air quality in cities. Incidents of high air pollution levels also have health impacts, but these are less important than longer term exposures, and related statistics are less reliable in view of greater variability due to external factors, we therefore do recommend a more specific articulation of this indicator to as annual means as a way to monitor SDG achievement. \nFine particulate matter: Fine particulate matter (i.e. PM2.5) can be directly linked to estimates of health risks. Coarse particulate matter (i.e. PM10) measurements can be converted to PM2.5, but will inherently introduce additional uncertainty to estimates of impacts (e.g. health). Articulating this indicator to fine particulate matter increases its specificity and its relevance for monitoring the health impacts of sustainable development policies. \nPopulation weighted: The population size of cities vary within a country. Weighting annual mean air quality measurements of fine PM by the city population size relative to other cities in a country increases the suitability and measurability of this indicator at a national scale. Furthermore it makes estimating the related impacts on health and other sustainable development issues (e.g. improvements in energy efficiency from sustainable transport) more feasbile and accurate for monitoring progress.","reporting_status":"complete","scheduled_update_by_SDG_team":"2018-09-30","scheduled_update_by_national_source":"2018-07-31","sdg_goal":11,"source_active_1":true,"source_agency_staff_email_1":"mintz.david@epa.gov","source_agency_staff_name_1":"David Mintz","source_agency_survey_dataset_1":"United States Environmental Protection Agency","source_notes_1":null,"source_organisation_1":"United States Environmental Protection Agency","source_title_1":null,"source_url_1":"https://www.epa.gov/air-trends/air-quality-cities-and-counties","source_url_text_1":"https://www.epa.gov/air-trends/air-quality-cities-and-counties","target":"By 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management.","target_id":"11.6","time_period":"2000 to most recent complete year of data.
