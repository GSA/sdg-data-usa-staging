When a sample, rather than the entire population, is surveyed, there is a chance that the sample estimates may differ from the true population values they represent. The component of this difference that occurs because samples differ by chance is known as sampling error, and its variability is measured by the standard error of the estimate.

Nonsampling error can occur for many reasons, including the failure to sample a segment of the population,  inability to obtain information for all respondents in the sample, inability or unwillingness of respondents to provide correct information, and errors made in the collection or processing of the data.

Persons who were waiting to be recalled to a job from which they had been laid off need not have been looking for work to be classified as unemployed. The civilian labor force comprises all persons classified as employed or unemployed. The CPS uses a set of six questions to identify persons with disabilities. In the CPS, persons are classified as having a disability if there is a response of \"\"yes\"\" to any of these questions: 1.\tIs anyone deaf or does anyone have serious difficulty hearing? 2.\tIs anyone blind or does anyone have serious difficulty seeing even when wearing glasses? 3.\tBecause of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, does anyone have serious difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions? 4.\tDoes anyone have serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs? 5.\tDoes anyone have difficulty dressing or bathing? 6.\tBecause of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, does anyone have difficulty doing errands alone such as visiting a doctor's office or shopping?","comments_and_limitations":"The questions noted above were added to the CPS in June 2008 to identify persons with a  disability in the civilian noninstitutional population age 16 and older.

It reflects the inability of an economy to generate employment for those persons who want to work but are not doing so, even though they are available for employment and actively seeking work. It is thus seen as an indicator of the efficiency and effectiveness of an economy to absorb its labour force and of the performance of the labour market. Short-term time series of the unemployment rate can be used to signal changes in the business cycle; upward movements in the indicator often coincide with recessionary periods or in some cases with the beginning of an expansionary period as persons previously not in the labour market begin to test conditions through an active job search. </p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>Even though in most developed countries the unemployment rate is useful as an indicator of labour market performance, and specifically, as a key measure of labour underutilization, in many developing countries, the significance and meaning of the unemployment rate could be questioned. In the absence of unemployment insurance systems or social safety nets, persons of working age must avoid unemployment, resorting to engaging in some form of economic activity, however insignificant or inadequate. Thus, in this context, other measures should supplement the unemployment rate to comprehensively assess labour underutilization. </p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>The computation is identical for both series:</p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">U</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">n</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">e</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">m</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">p</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">l</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">o</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">y</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">m</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">e</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">n</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">t</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">r</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">a</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">t</mi>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">e</mi>\n    <mo>=</mo>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mfrac>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">T</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">o</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">t</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">a</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">l</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">u</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">n</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">e</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">m</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">p</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">l</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">o</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">y</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">m</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">e</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">n</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">t</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">T</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">o</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">t</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">a</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">l</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">l</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">a</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">b</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">o</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">u</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">r</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">f</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">o</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">r</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">c</mi>\n        <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">e</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </mfrac>\n    <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n    <mo>&#xD7;</mo>\n    <mn>100</mn>\n  </math></p>","DATA_VALIDATION__GLOBAL":"<p>The ILO engages in annual consultations with Member States through the ILOSTAT questionnaire and related Statistics Reporting System (StaRS).
