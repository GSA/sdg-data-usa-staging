Sexual violence as defined in para 60 of the UN Guidelines for Producing Statistics on Violence against Women: Statistical Surveys [1]: ... is any sort of harmful or unwanted sexual behavior that is imposed on someone. It includes act of abusive sexual contact, forced engagement in sexual acts, attempted or completed sexual acts with a woman without her consent, sexual harassment, verbal abuse, threats, exposure, unwanted touching, incest, etc. A minimum list of acts of sexual violence, which should be expanded depending on the specific country context, consists of the following: (a) Rape: Refers to engaging in the non-consensual vaginal, anal, or oral penetration of a sexual nature of the body of another person with any bodily part or object, including through the use of physical violence and by putting the victim in a situation where she cannot say no or complies because of fear; (b) Attempted rape: Refers to attempting to have non-consensual sexual intercourse through the use of force or threats; (c) Other sexual acts: Refers to: \tIntimate touching without consent \tSexual acts other than intercourse forced by money \tSexual acts other than intercourse obtained through threats of physical violence \tSexual acts other than intercourse obtained through threats to the well-being of family members \tUse of force or coercion to obtain unwanted sexual acts or any sexual activity that the female partner finds degrading or humiliating \tOther acts of sexual violence. The indicator specifically considers the following: 1) sexual violence (separately from physical violence); 2) women and girls aged 15+ who were subjected to sexual violence; and 3) by perpetrators who are persons other than an intimate partner.  This indicator provides the proportion of ever-partnered girls and women aged 15+ subjected to physical, sexual or psychological violence in the last 12 months by a current or former intimate partner. It is calculated by dividing the number of ever-partnered girls and women aged 15+ subjected to physical, sexual or psychological in the last 12 months by a current or former intimate partner by the total number of ever-partnered girls and women aged 15+ in the population.","indicator_sort_order":"05-02-02","indicator_variable":"rev_rape_def","layout":"indicator","method_of_computation":"NA","published":true,"rationale_interpretation":"Violence against women and girls is one of the most pervasive human rights abuses in the world today and takes place in all countries.

Violence against women shall be understood to encompass, but not be limited to, the following: [&#x2026;], Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring within the general community, including rape, sexual abuse, sexual harassment and intimidation at work, in educational institutions and elsewhere, trafficking in women and forced prostitution [&#x2026;]&#x201D;.

It includes acts of abusive sexual contact, forced engagement in sexual acts, attempted or completed sexual acts without consent, incest, sexual harassment, etc. However, in most surveys that collect data on sexual violence against women and girls by non-partners the information collected is limited to forcing someone into sexual intercourse when she does not want to, as well as attempting to force someone to perform a sexual act against her will or attempting to force her into sexual intercourse. </p>\n<p>For a more detailed definition of sexual violence against women see <em>Guidelines for Producing Statistics on Violence against Women- Statistical Surveys</em> (UN, 2014).</p>","SOURCE_TYPE__GLOBAL":"<p>The main sources of intimate partner violence prevalence data are (1) specialized national surveys dedicated to measuring violence against women and (2) international household surveys that include a module on experiences of violence by women, such as the DHS.</p>\n<p>Although administrative data from health, police, courts, justice and social services, among other services used by survivors of violence, can provide information on violence against women and girls, these do not produce prevalence data, but rather incidence data or number of cases received in/reported to these services. We know that many abused women do not report violence and those who do, tend to be only the most serious cases. Therefore, administrative data should not be used as a data source for this indicator. </p>\n<p>For more information on recommended practices in production of violence against women statistics see: <em>UN Guidelines for Producing Statistics on Violence against Women- Statistical Surveys</em> (UN, 2014).</p>","COLL_METHOD__GLOBAL":"<p>An Inter-Agency Group on Violence against Women Data and its Technical Advisory Group is currently being established (jointly by WHO, UN Women, UNICEF, UNSD and UNFPA) to establish a mechanism for compiling harmonized country level data on this indicator.</p>","FREQ_COLL__GLOBAL":"<p>NA</p>","REL_CAL_POLICY__GLOBAL":"<p>NA</p>","DATA_SOURCE__GLOBAL":"<p>National Statistical Offices (in most cases) or line ministries/other government agencies that have conducted national surveys on violence against women and girls.</p>","COMPILING_ORG__GLOBAL":"<p>UN Women, UNICEF, UNSD, WHO, UNFPA</p>","RATIONALE__GLOBAL":"<p>Violence against women and girls is one of the most pervasive forms of human rights violations in the world. Evidence has shown that globally, an estimated 7% of women have been sexually assaulted by someone other than a partner at some point in their lives (WHO et al., 2013).

Diverse age groups are also often utilized. Willingness to discuss experiences of violence and understanding of relevant concepts may also differ according to the cultural context and this can affect reported prevalence levels.</p>\n<p>Efforts and investment will be required to develop an internationally-agreed standard and definition of sexual violence by non-partners that will enable comparison across countries.</p>\n<p><u>Regularity of data production:</u></p>\n<p>Since 1995, only some 40 countries have conducted more than one survey on violence against women and girls. Obtaining data on violence against women and girls is a costly and time-consuming exercise, no matter if they are obtained through stand-alone dedicated surveys or through modules inserted in other surveys. Not all VAW surveys, however, collect information on non-intimate partner violence.
