Concepts Women of reproductive age include all women of reproductive age (15-49) who are married or in consensual union. Contraceptive methods include modern and traditional methods. Modern methods of contraception include female and male sterilization, oral hormonal pills, intra-uterine devices (IUD), male condoms, injectables, implants (including Norplant), vaginal barrier methods, female condoms, and emergency contraception.

Unmet need for family planning is the proportion of women of reproductive age (15'49 years) either married or in a consensual union, who are fecund and sexually active but who are not using any method of contraception (modern or traditional), and report not wanting any more children or wanting to delay the birth of their next child for at least two years. Included are: (i) all pregnant women (married or in a consensual union) whose pregnancies were unwanted or mistimed at the time of conception; (ii) all postpartum amenorrhoeic women (married or in consensual union) who are not using family planning and whose last birth was unwanted or mistimed; (iii) all fecund women (married or in consensual union) who are neither pregnant nor postpartum amenorrhoeic, and who either do not want any more children (want to limit family size), or who wish to postpone the birth of a child for at least two years or do not know when or if they want another child (want to space births), but are not using any contraceptive method.From Population Division/DESA, United Nations: The numerator is the percentage of women of reproductive age (15-49 years old) who are currently using, or whose sexual partner is currently using, at least one modern contraceptive method. The denominator is the total demand for family planning (the sum of contraceptive prevalence (any method) and the unmet need for family planning. Metadata on the definition, method of computation and other information for each component' contraceptive prevalence and unmet need for family planning'are included in the MDG database as each was an indicator (5.3 and 5.6) used for global monitoring of MDG target 5.B. Achieve, by 2015, universal access to reproductive health. An important limitation, though, of the indicators used in MDG monitoring is that they were only with reference to women of reproductive age who are married or in a union. The indicators missed women who are not married but who are exposed to the risk of pregnancy. See http://unstats.un.org/unsd/mdg/Metadata.aspx The proposed indicator limits the numerator to women who are using a modern method of family planning. Women who are using a traditional method of contraception are not considered as having a met need for family planning. In contrast, the indicator 'Demand for family planning satisfied (met need for contraception)' (regardless if the method used is modern or traditional).is a key indicator under the Every Woman, Every Child initiative and is described in detail in the handbook 'Monitoring maternal, newborn and child health: understanding key progress indicators' available here from WHO (2011): http://www.who.int/entity/healthmetrics/news/monitoring_maternal_newborn_child_health.pdf.From UNFPA:  ( Women using a contraceptive method / Women of reproductive age ) X 100","periodicity":"Every four years starting in 2006","published":true,"rationale_interpretation":"From Population Division/DESA, United Nations: \nWhile it is difficult to define an ideal level of contraceptive prevalence, since it is dependent, in part, on women's and men fertility preferences, the proportion of demand for family planning satisfied can be interpreted as the degree to which total demand for contraception has been met with an ideal (if improbable) target of 100 per cent demand met. \n\"The proportion of demand for family planning satisfied (met need for contraception) indicator enables assessment of family planning programmes and progress in providing contraceptive services to women who wish to avoid getting pregnant. Access to family planning provides women and their partners opportunities to make decisions about family size and timing of pregnancies. This contributes to maternal and child health by preventing unintended pregnancies and pregnancies that are too closely spaced, which are at higher risk for poor obstetrical outcomes. Unmet need for family planning shows the gap between women's reproductive intentions and their access to or use of contraceptives. The CPR provides an estimate of contraceptive use in a population. Both the unmet need for family planning and CPR indicators are used for tracking progress towards the MDG 5 target 5B of achieving universal access to reproductive health.\" (WHO, 2011)\n\nFrom UNFPA: \n The contraceptive prevalence rate, which serves as a proxy measure of access to reproductive health services, is useful for tracking progress towards the target of achieving universal access to reproductive health, especially when the indicator is considered in conjunction with information about women's knowledge of family planning or accessibility, and the quality of family planning services. Information on contraceptive prevalence complements the indicator of unmet need for family planning. The sum of contraceptive prevalence and unmet need determines the total demand for contraception. Unlike the unmet need indicator, contraceptive prevalence does not take into account whether women or couples do or do not desire additional children. This makes the indicator more difficult to interpret than unmet need because contraceptive prevalence rates vary across societies with vastly different preferred family sizes. For the same reason, it is difficult to specify the desired target for contraceptive prevalence rates.","sdg_goal":3,"source_active_1":true,"source_agency_staff_email_1":"ambranum@cdc.gov","source_agency_staff_name_1":"National Survey of Family Growth, Reproductive Statistics Branch, Division of Vital Statistics, National Center for Health Statistics","source_agency_survey_dataset_1":"National Center for Health Statistics/National Survey of Family Growth","source_notes_1":null,"source_organisation_1":"National Center for Health Statistics/National Survey of Family Growth","source_title_1":null,"source_url_1":"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/nsfg_2011_2013_puf.htm","source_url_text_1":"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/nsfg_2011_2013_puf.htm","target":"By 2030, ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, including for family planning, information and education, and the integration of reproductive health into national strategies and programmes.","target_id":"3.7","time_period":"2002-2015","title":"Proportion of women of reproductive age (aged 15-49 years) who have their need for family planning satisfied with modern methods","un_custodial_agency":"DESA Population Division (Partnering Agencies: UNFPA, WHO)","un_designated_tier":"1","us_method_of_computation":"Measures the contraceptive method used (if any) in the month of the interview (not at a specific act of sexual intercourse) among female participants aged 15-44 in the National Survey of Family Growth.

Access to and use of an effective means to prevent pregnancy helps enable women and their partners to exercise their rights to decide freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children and to have the information, education and means to do so. Meeting demand for family planning with modern methods also contributes to maternal and child health by preventing unintended pregnancies and closely spaced pregnancies, which are at higher risk for poor obstetrical outcomes. </p>\n<p>Levels of demand for family planning satisfied with modern methods of 75 percent or more are generally considered high, and values of 50 percent or less are generally considered as very low. The indicator has no global numerical &#x2018;target&#x2019; value set to be achieved by 2030. Looking at the highest values of the indicator, in 22 countries representing regions such as Europe and Northern America, Latin America and the Caribbean and Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, more than 85 percent of women who want to avoid pregnancy are using a modern contraceptive method but for no country is this estimate above 91 percent. </p>\n<p>Even in these countries, specific sub-populations (for example, adolescents or the poor) can still face barriers of access to family planning information and services. It should also be recognized that reaching 100 percent may not be a necessary or even desirable outcome with respect to reproductive rights. Some women may prefer to use a traditional method, even while having access to a full range of modern methods and being aware of the typical differences in effectiveness of methods in preventing pregnancies. Other women might have ambivalent preferences regarding their next pregnancy which may influence their contraceptive choice.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>Differences in the survey design and implementation, as well as differences in the way survey questionnaires are formulated and administered can affect the comparability of the data. The most common differences relate to the range of contraceptive methods included and the characteristics (age, sex, marital or union status) of the persons for whom contraceptive prevalence is estimated (base population). The time frame used to assess contraceptive prevalence can also vary. In most surveys there is no definition of what is meant by &#x201C;currently using&#x201D; a method of contraception.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In some surveys, the lack of probing questions, asked to ensure that the respondent understands the meaning of the different contraceptive methods, can result in an underestimation of contraceptive prevalence, in particular for traditional methods. Sampling variability can also be an issue, especially when contraceptive prevalence is measured for a specific subgroup (by age-group, level of educational attainment, place of residence, etc.) or when analysing trends over time. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When data on all women aged 15 to 49 are not available, information for married or in-union women is reported.
